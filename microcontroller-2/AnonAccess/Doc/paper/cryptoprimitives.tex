\section{Cryptographic algorithms used}
We use the following cryptographic primitives:
\begin{itemize}
 \item SHA-256 hash function as specified in \cite{FIPS180-2}
 \item HMAC-SHA256 MAC function as specified in \cite{RFC2104}
 \item Shabea with 16 rounds as data encryption algorithm as specified in Appendix B
 \item a PRNG as specified in Appendix A
\end{itemize}
