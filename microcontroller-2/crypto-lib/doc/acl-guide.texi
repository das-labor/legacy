@chapter About
This documentation is a guide to the AVR-Crypto-Lib and ARM-Crypto-Lib.
Instead of documenting the full API and each function we choose the approach
of documenting the structure of the API so you know what to do when you want
to use the library.

@chapter Generic stuff
@section File organisation
@section Build process
@section Testing system
@section Sizes in bits and bytes
 Working with cryptographic functions involves working with different
 lengths. Some times you want to know it in bits, sometimes in bytes and another
 time in words (how long a word is must be defined by the context).
 To reduce confusion, frustration and to avoid bugs we suffix a length 
 parameter with either _b, _B or _w depending on the meaning. 
 _b means in bits and _B means in bytes (big b big word) and _w meaning words.
