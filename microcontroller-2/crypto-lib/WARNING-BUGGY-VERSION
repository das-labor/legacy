 The current version of the AVR-Crypto-Lib is BUGGY
====================================================

This is due to our afford of integrating newly optimized versions of the 
UART interface and the cli tools.

We are working on this problem.

Please use a revision prior to 2009-07-28.
This means use
 svn revisions up to revision 2832 and
