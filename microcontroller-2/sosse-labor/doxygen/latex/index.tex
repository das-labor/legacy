\subsection*{Overview}

SOSSE is a simple operating system for smart cards which is opensource and free. It has been developed to provide a smart card platform for learning, experimenting and implementing inovative concepts. The hardware platform choosen for this project are the Funcards based on commercial-of-the-shelf AVR microcontrollers, because the hardware documentation is available without non-disclosure agreement.



\subsection*{Hardware}

All of the currently supported cards use the AVR-Microcontrollers from {\tt Atmel}. The are e.g. called Funcard, Jupiter or Pink card. The used AVRs are the AT90S2323, AT90S2343, AT90S8515 and AT90S8535. There are even a few boards with the ATmega161 available. The data sheets for all Atmel AVR microcontrollers are available on the Atmel website.

 \begin{Image}

\includegraphics[width=8cm]{purple}\caption{Connection scheme for the AVR cards.}
\end{center}
\end{Image}


The pinout of the AVR cards is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item C1 (VCC): Vcc \item C2 (RST): RESET \item C3 (CLK): XTAL \item C4: MOSI \item C5 (VSS): Vss \item C6: Not connected \item C7 (I/O): MISO \item C8: SCK \end{itemize}


Additional to the smart cards, a programmer is needed. These are available at the same shops as the AVR cards.

\subsection*{Software}

SOSSE has been developed using the GCC development tools. These are available at {\tt http://combio.de/avr/}. There are the sources, binaries and RPMs for Linux and binaries for MS Windows.

\subsection*{Design Decisions}

\subsubsection*{Programming Language}

The C programming language has been choosen instead of assembler, because:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is easier to understand C source code. \item Modern smart card operating systems are probably all written mostly in C. Who does want to write and verify 128k\-B assembler code? \item When new smart card architectures are available for SOSSE, these can be utilized more easily. \end{itemize}


\subsection*{Building Instructions}

\subsubsection*{Standard Build}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to the src directory and edit \doxyref{config.h}{p.}{config_8h}. This file contains the configuration data for the build process. The meaning of the options is described in the doxygen documention of \doxyref{config.h}{p.}{config_8h} itself. (It is not possible to switch on all features, because then the code size is above 8k\-B.)

\item You can edit eedata.S if you want to change the EEPROM data loaded onto the AVR card. You might want to change the card serial number, the start value for the random number generator, the keys, the file permissions or the created files.

\item There are two defines in the Makefile, which could need editing. The first is the -mmcu setting in CC and the second is -mtiny-stack in CFLAGS. Adjust these to reflect your used AVR card.

\item To build the HEX files start {\em make\/}.

\item The resulting HEX files sosse.hex and eedata.hex (or BIN files sosse.bin and eedata.bin) have then to be loaded on the card with the programmer and an apropriate software. The destination for sosse.hex is the Flash and for eedata.hex the internal EEPROM.

\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection*{Debugging}

Test programms which run natively on the host operating system are built running:

make -f Makefile.emu

These can be used for comfortable debugging and testing using the normal GNU debugger. When the reset sequence is implemented, this can be used to simulate a SOSSE smart card via e.g. a Season interface.

\subsubsection*{CT-API driver}

\paragraph*{Building}

A virtual card sitting in a virtual reader can be build with:

make -f Makefile.ctapi

This builds a CT-API driver, which can be used to test applications and to debug using a normal debugger.

\paragraph*{Supported CT-BCS commands}

\begin{itemize}
\item EJECT ICC: Supported with functional unit ICC1. P2 is ignored. \item GET STATUS: Supported tag is 80. Possible card states are 01 and 05. \item REQUEST ICC: Supported with functional unit ICC1 and response data none and complete ATR. Display settings are ignored. \item RESET CT: Supported with functional unit CT and ICC1 and response data none and complete ATR. This command is the same as REQUEST ICC, but does support reseting the CT, which stops the ICC. \end{itemize}

\end{TabularC}


\paragraph*{Description}

This command sets the parameter for EEPROM loading and saving for the virtual card.

If bit 1 of P1 is set, the EEPROM is saved at stopping of the ICC and if bit 2 is set, the EEPROM loaded at starting of the ICC. The file name for this operation is specified in the data field of the command.

{\em The proprietary commands must be executed before a REQUEST ICC and RESET CT, because the parameters are held in RAM, which is separated by a fork at card reset.\/}

{\em A success of the command means only, that the variables have correctly been set. It does not verify, that the file is createable, readable or writeable.\/}

\paragraph*{Description}

This command does control the LEDs present on some PCB AVR cards and shows some nice effects.

Effect type 0x01 does switch the LEDs specified in P2 on. Each bit controlls one LED. Which LED is controlled may be card dependent. Currently bits 0 - 6 control the leds beginning from the left, when looking down at them with the contacts to the top.

Effect type 0x02 does implement a runlight with the left 4 LED block. It may need adjustment on other cards to select the correct LEDs.

{\em This command is only enabled when setting CONF\_\-WITH\_\-FUNNY to 1.\/}
