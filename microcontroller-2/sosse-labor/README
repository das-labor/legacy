SOSSE is documented inside the source. Printable/browsable documentation
is generated with doxygen. A "make" in the top level directory will
also build the documentation. If you do not have doxygen installed and
do not want to install it, you find the most important documentation in
"src/main.h". You can also browse it online at:

This version of SOSSE includes changes by Daniel Otte (daniel.otte@rub.de) to
make it compatible with current versions of avr-libc.
