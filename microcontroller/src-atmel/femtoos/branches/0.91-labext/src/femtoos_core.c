 * Except in the beginning, the Read (pointer) and Write (pointer) are never equal.
 * This is because otherwise you could not see the difference between a
 * full and an empty queue. This would imply that one byte is effectively lost,
 * for it could never be retrieved. Such a waste! We must solve this
 * by storing one bit of information that differentiates between a full and an
 * empty queue, when Read and Write are equal. But where?
 * It seems reasonable to limit the size of queue's to 127 bytes. Now we have
 * two extra bits available (upper bits of Read/Write storage). Second advantage
 * is that we can address the whole queue, from the queue Requests. What we don't
 * know at this moment if this will cost a lot of code.
 * Now, we decided to reserve a bit to indicate that the queue is full, is
 * it handy to use the other for indicating an empty queue? Well, it may be,
 * but, since queue's are empty at startup, we want to indicate the bit
 * empty by zero. Hmmm, that implies a lot of code. It may be shorter to
 * just ask for Read==Write and !full. Ok let us see what happens.
 * Now we keep the write pointers in uiQueuWrite[] and the read pointers in
 * uiQueuRead[]. The write operation is write-post-decrement, and the read
 * operation likewise. The pointers wrap when they hit the bottom of the queue.
 * Thus we write/read downwards, the wrapping is easier detected that way.
