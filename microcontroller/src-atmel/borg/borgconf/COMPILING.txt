**** Ubuntu Linux *****
To Compile for the AVR you'll need the packages gcc-avr and avr-libc. You'll
also need gcc and libncurses to be able to use menuconfig. To use the simulator
you'll also need libglut.

Type 
$ make menuconfig
and set your settings or load one of the default profiles. Then type
$ make
to compile for the avr. You can upload the image to a borg-16's serial 
bootloader (foodloader) by typing
$ make sflash
.


****Windows XP****
Under Windows you'll need to install the following things:
-WinAVR
-Cygwin with the following packages:
--gcc
--libncurses-devel
--make (the one that WinAVR delivers doesn't work right)
--opengl (for the simulator)

now go to the cygwin bash shell and use the same commands as with Linux to
compile and flash.
