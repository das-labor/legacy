General Description:
This file contains parts of the USB driver which can be configured and can or
must be adapted to your hardware.

Please note that the usbdrv contains a usbconfig-prototype.h file now. We
recommend that you use that file as a template because it will always list
the newest features and options.

/* ---------------------------- Hardware Config ---------------------------- */

#define USB_CFG_IOPORTNAME      D
/* This is the port where the USB bus is connected. When you configure it to
 * "PORTB", the registers PORTB, PINB (=PORTB-2) and DDRB (=PORTB-1) will be
 * used.
 */
#define USB_CFG_DMINUS_BIT      0
/* This is the bit number in USB_CFG_IOPORT where the USB D- line is connected.
 * This MUST be bit 0 or 7. All other values will result in a compile error!
 */
#define USB_CFG_DPLUS_BIT       2
/* This is the bit number in USB_CFG_IOPORT where the USB D+ line is connected.
 * This may be any bit in the port. Please note that D+ must also be connected
 * to interrupt pin INT0!
 */

/* #define USB_CFG_PULLUP_IOPORTNAME   B */
/* This is the port where the USB D- pullup resistor is connected. When you
 * configure it to "PORTB", the registers PORTB and DDRB (=PORTB-1) will be
 * used. If this constant is defined, the macros usbDeviceConnect() and
 * usbDeviceDisconnect will be available.
 */
/* #define USB_CFG_PULLUP_BIT          2 */
/* This is the bit number in USB_CFG_PULLUP_IOPORT where the USB D- 1.5 kOhm
 * pullup resistor is connected instead of VBUS. This may be any bit in
 * the port.
 */

/* --------------------------- Functional Range ---------------------------- */

#define USB_CFG_HAVE_INTRIN_ENDPOINT    0
/* Define this to 1 if you want to compile a version with two endpoints: The
 * default control endpoint 0 and an interrupt-in endpoint 1.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IMPLEMENT_HALT          0
/* Define this to 1 if you also want to implement the ENDPOINT_HALT feature
 * for endpoint 1 (interrupt endpoint). Although you may not need this feature,
 * it is required by the standard. We have made it a config option because it
 * bloats the code considerably.
 */
#define USB_CFG_INTR_POLL_INTERVAL      10
/* If you compile a version with endpoint 1 (interrupt-in), this is the poll
 * interval. The value is in milliseconds and must not be less than 10 ms for
 * low speed devices.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IS_SELF_POWERED         1
/* Define this to 1 if the device has its own power supply. Set it to 0 if the
 * device is powered from the USB bus.
 */
#define USB_CFG_MAX_BUS_POWER           20
/* Set this variable to the maximum USB bus power consumption of your device.
 * The value is in milliamperes. [It will be divided by two since USB
 * communicates power requirements in units of 2 mA.]
 */
#define USB_CFG_SAMPLE_EXACT            0
/* This variable affects Sampling Jitter for USB receiving. When it is 0, the
 * driver guarantees a sampling window of 1/2 bit. The USB spec requires
 * that the receiver has at most 1/4 bit sampling window. The 1/2 bit window
 * should still work reliably enough because we work at low speed. If you want
 * to meet the spec, set this value to 1. This will unroll a loop which
 * results in bigger code size.
 * If you have problems with long cables, try setting this value to 1.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IMPLEMENT_FN_WRITE      0
/* Set this to 1 if you want usbFunctionWrite() to be called for control-out
 * transfers. Set it to 0 if you don't need it and want to save a couple of
 * bytes.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IMPLEMENT_FN_READ       0
/* Set this to 1 if you need to send control replies which are generated
 * "on the fly" when usbFunctionRead() is called. If you only want to send
 * data from a static buffer, set it to 0 and return the data from
 * usbFunctionSetup(). This saves a couple of bytes.

 * VID/PID pair. Be sure to read USBID-License.txt for rules!
 */
#define USB_CFG_DEVICE_ID   0xdc, 0x05  /* 1500 in dec, obdev's free PID */

 * scope of the vendor ID. If you have registered your own VID with usb.org
 * or if you have licensed a PID from somebody else, define it here. Otherwise
 * you use obdev's free shared VID/PID pair. Be sure to read the rules in

 * are interpreted as Unicode (UTF-16) entities.
 * If you don't want a vendor name string, undefine these macros.

/* Set this define to the number of charcters in the serial number if your
 * device should have a serial number to uniquely identify each hardware
 * instance. You must supply the serial number in a string descriptor with the
 * name "usbCfgSerialNumberStringDescriptor", e.g.:

 * You may want to put "usbCfgSerialNumberStringDescriptor" at a constant

 * to recompile if you change it.
