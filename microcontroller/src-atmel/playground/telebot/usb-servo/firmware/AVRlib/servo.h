/// \code #include "servo.h" \endcode
/// \par Overview
///		This code allows you to drive up to 8 RC servos from any
///	combination of ports and pins on the AVR processor. Using interrupts,
///	this code continuously sends control signals to the servo to maintain
///	position even while your code is doing other work.
///
///	The servoInit and servoOff effectively turn on and turn off servo
///	control.  When you run ServoInit, it automatically assigns each
///	"channel" of servo control to be output on the SERVO_DEFAULT_PORT.
///	One "channel" of servo control can control one servo and must be
///	assigned single I/O pin for output.
///
///	If you're using all eight channels (SERVO_NUM_CHANNELS = 8), then
///	then by default the code will use SERVO_DEFAULT_PORT pins 0-7.
///	If you're only using four channels, then pins 0-3 will be used by
///	default.
///
///	The command servoSetChannelIO(channel, port, pin) allows you to
///	reassign the output of any channel to any port and I/O pin you
///	choose.  For exampe, if you have an RC servo connected to PORTC, pin 6,
///	and you wish to use channel 2 to control it, use:
///
///		servoSerChannelIO( 2, _SFR_IO_ADDR(PORTC), 6)
///
///		(NOTE: you must include the "_SRF_IO_ADDR()" part around your port)
///
///	The servoSetPostion and servoGetPosition commands allow you to command
///	a given servo to your desired position.  The position you request must
///	lie between the SERVO_MIN and SERVO_MAX limit you defined.
///
/// \WARNING: This servo library has been tested to work without issue on
///	several different AVR processors and with several different brands/kinds
/// of servos.  However:
/// - Proper output duty cylces are dependent upon a user calibation and
///		configuration.
/// - IF YOUR SERVOS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY POWERFUL, AN ERRONEOUS OUTPUT DUTY
///		CYCLE GENERATED FROM THIS CODE OR ANY OTHER SOURCE CAN DAMAGE YOUR
///		SERVO'S INTERNAL DRIVER CHIP OR ITS GEARS!
/// - I have never experienced any servo damage from erroneous control signal
///		input, but it is possible.
