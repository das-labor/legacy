 * Tick hooks for every tick (appTick00), for every 256 ticks (appTick08) and every
 * 65536 ticks (appTick16) in case of power down the tick00 and tick08 may be lost.
 * Ticks16 may be deferred. In case of variable time slices the hooks may be deferred,
 * tick 00 may come in rapid repetition. to catch up. ticks are not missed.
 * tick16 may for example be used to extend the tick counter. All routines run in
 * OS space with used stacks. Keep the functions shallow and quick, also the
 * tick16 function. API calls are NOT allowed from within. However, tick interrupts
 * are disabled when the functions are called, so share variables are save. Global
 * interrupts may not be disabled.
