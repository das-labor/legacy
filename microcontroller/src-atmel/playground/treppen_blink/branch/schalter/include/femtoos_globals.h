 * We don't use primitive data types in the code anywhere. All types are related

 * a lot of 8 bit operations to 16 bit. Although this is standard behavior, and
 * can be suppressed with the right casts, to my opinion this has been the wrong
 * choice. C is a machine language and should respect the true lengths of the
 * defined variables. Note that it seems that GCC does not honor the bit lengths
 * defined; so why are the present anyway? With -mint8 int32_t becomes a 16 bit

 * will not corrupt the task stack is the context does not fit (it will skip the save in

 * corrupt a stack. Fatal errors are reported indefinitely.
 * The error consists off 3x 8bit, with the following format:
 * SSfx xxxx ssss tttt
 *     SS: signbits, used to blink, cleared in the call 10, 01
 *  xxxxx: error number
 *      f: fatal error
