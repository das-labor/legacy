/**
 * TtaskSave is the structure which holds the "background" variables. These are the variables which
 * are kept while a task is running. In fact, it is a way to communicate information from portRestoreContext
 * to portSaveContext. Also it is used to save some registers temporarily during port(Save/Restore)Context.
 * We have two versions depending on the direction of stack growth. Note that, since some of these variables
 * must be retained until the OS has restarted, some buffer variables are needed. These keep a save
 * distance between the variables needed and the building OS stack. Also, if we have no checking switched
 * on, we can use a shorter version of the TtaskSave.
 * The number of buffer variables is 4 at a minimum (2 addresses, namely a call to privInitOs() and a possible
 * subsequent call to tcbCurrent(). It is assumed that those functions do not push more variables on the
 * stack. This must be checked. In case we have no checking, only one address is pushed so we need only 2
 * buffer variables (one address).
 * Please note the the order of the variables is of the utmost importance, do not change it unless you
 * know what you are doing (and believe me, you don't yet). Just to get you going, mark these facts:
 * - The register-copy variables r31-r28 are filled at the beginning of the save context and restored
 *   at the end, because we must leave all registers untouched. The restore is thus done after the stack
 *   change to OS. Thus these variables may not be overwritten, and therefore the place to store them is
 *   as far as possible from the return address that is placed upon the OS stack.
 * - uiStackTCheck, uiRegisterCheck and uiRegisterUse are used to check the result of the context switch
 *   in privInitOS. Depending on their values, the task may be terminated. So these values should survive
 *   the first method calls to and in privInitOS.
 * - in standard operation, no registers are needed from the background variables after a return from save
 *   context. However, when checks are in place, some variables are read after the return. Those variables
 *   must be preserved upon the return. The return itself destroys at least 2 (3 for mega256) bytes, and
 *   after return there must be room for two consecutive jumps, i.e. 4 (6) bytes.
 *
 *   Note: make sure that any change in this structure is reflected in the defTaskSaveSize constant!
