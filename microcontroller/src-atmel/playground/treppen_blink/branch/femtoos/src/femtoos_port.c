/* DISCUSSION
 * The port(Enter/Exit)(Global/Tick)Interrupts methods must temporarily store
 * the value of the interrupt state and restore it when needed. These methods
 * are only called from within the Femto OS and are never nested, and you should not
 * call them yourself. (other functions are available). Since we did not want to make
 * inserts (although you can still do so, by turning them into defines)
 * because that takes a lot of extra bytes (a call is shorter) we cannot store
 * the status on the stack. Thus we decided to use, for example a general purpose
 * I/O register (devAuxSysReg) of the AVR tiny as temporary variable. This is used in
 * portSave- and portRestore Context also, but since we know we will never call a context
 * switch from within one of these Enter/Exit constructions, there is no risk
 * of double use. (Remember, you should not use these functions, the results
 * can be bizarre!)
 * Furthermore we make use of one bit of devAuxSysReg to catch the state of the current
 * global interrupt when a context switch occurs. Therefore, when running a task that
 * bit must always be zero; it is set if global interrupts are set on context switch.
 * Note that the functions portEnterGlobalInterrupts/portExitGlobalInterrupts
 * cannot rely on bit 7 being zero since these functions are used in isr's also.
 * This has been corrected by clearing this bit in the PortSaveContext.
 * From this it follows that it is forbidden to activate global or tick interrupts
 * in their respective critical sections by hand. It is not a very logical thing
 * to do either.
 * An other point of attention is the interrupt nesting due to external interrupts.
 * We do not allow interrupt nesting in principle, so you may not activate interrupts
 * inside an isr. If we have not protected the OS from outside interrupts, you may
 * not call genXXX methods, and if we do EnterSysCritical translates to global
 * interrupt management. Thus we can use for both portEnterGlobalInterrupts/portExit-
 * GlobalInterrupts and portEnterTickInterrupts/portExitTickInterrupts the same
 * storage room for the interrupt state since they can never be nested.
 * Remember for user critical nesting there are other facilities. The former are
 * solely for the OS and are meant to be as brief as possible.

/* DISCUSSION
 * Below you will find the portSave and portRestore context. The code in these routines is build on the settings
 * of the configuration parameters of the different tasks. First, we distinguish to main blocks, of which only
 * one is compiled depending on the setting of cfgCheckRegisters, cfgCheckTaskStack, cfgCheckWatermarks. If one of
 * these is cfgTrue, checks are performed on the use of the registers or stack, i.e. this is protected context switching.
 * For every group of registers it is
 * decided separately if check or save/restore actions are needed. In general this is the approach:
 * (1) Registers that are used in all tasks are always saved/restored, and no code is added to test if
 *     these actions should be skipped, since there is no need.
 * (2) Registers that are used in some tasks are conditionally saved/restored.
 * (3) Registers that are used in none of the tasks are completely left out of save/restore.
 * The same kind of scheme holds with respect to register use checking, since this may be specified separately,
 * but now for filling with the check byte and checking against the check byte.
 * Of course this code is all AVR specific.

/* DISCUSSION
 * One might wonder why there is so much work on the Save Context. Would porting not be
 * a lot simpler if we just saved the registers and the status, and left stack switching
 * and interrupt capture to the OS? Well, yes but there is a problem too. Some of the
 * OS function calls are switching, which means that as the application calls the function
 * a task switch must be performed also. Standard OS implementation perform function handling
 * in task space, issuing a copy of all OS handling on every stack. We use the OS stack so
 * we must switch stack and save the interrupts while leaving ALL registers in unchanged since
 * they might contain parameters of the calling function. GCC is not capable of generating
 * such code, so it must be done by hand.
