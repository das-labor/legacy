/* DISCUSSION:
 * Several methods are defined through preprocessor definitions only. This
 * applies for the isrXXX methods, depending on the use they are coupled to
 * portXXX or privXXX methods. You cannot, in general make regular functions of
 * these methods, due to balanced stack depth.
 */


/**
 * General information. The method names below are as descriptive as i
 * could think of. The nomenclature is as follows:
 * privXXXX: this method is for internal use only. It is defined here
 *   because it may be called from the portable routines, or the may
 *   be part of a define. Never call them from application code.
 * portXXXX: methods that are part of the portable part of this system.
 *   These are rarely called, but there are some exceptions. It is,
 *   for example possible to directly call portShowError or so.
 *   Of course you never need to call portSaveContext or so, but also
 *   portEnable/DisbaleGlobalInterrupts are butter called through there
 *   equivalents taskEnable/DisableGlobalInterrupts.
 * genXXXXX: these methods contain code save to call from any environment,
 *   a task, an isr or from bark or init. They are non switching, and (tick)
 *   interrupt protected, depending on there function. Note some functions
 *   use quite a lot of stack. Note that, in case we have cfgIntOsProtected
 *   set to false, these functions are forbidden to call from an isr.
 * taskXXXX: these methods can only be called from an task environment. Never
 *   call them from isr or bark or init. They may be switching, i.e. start
 *   with a context switch.
 * isrXXXXX: methods that may only be called from within the isr.
 * appXXXXX: methods that you define as hooks in your application for the
 *   system to call. This includes the application loop, tick hooks etc.
 * Furthermore, quite a lot of methods take a task number or a slot number
 * as parameter. Since these numbers may not be constant, it is better
 * to use task names/slot names and let the preprocessor do the work for
 * you. All methods taking such parameters have defines with the name
 * xxxxOnName which take such parameters. Please consult the
 * example applications to see how to use them.
 *
 * Note that tasks calling methods utilizing a slot, can only hold one
 * slot at the time. Thus, you cannot for example request access to a
 * queue on slot 1 and then wait for a mutex on slot 2. furthermore, a slot
 * can only be used for one purpose at the time. Thus if one task utilizes
 * a slot for a rendezvous, and other task may not use the same slot for
 * a mutex at the same time. If you are sure this use cannot be mixed in
 * time, it is possible, even for queues. However, it is better to utilize
 * the slots for one purpose and avoid mixing. It does not cost extra
 * ram to make use of more or higher slot numbers. Slot number 0 must never
 * be used. See also the discussion in on Queue Usage.

   * full processor time, and will behave like a top priority task.
   *
   * The system will prevent switching while possible. Thus, your task will
   * keep complete load as long as you do not block, call sleep, suspend or
   * terminate your task. Calling delay is possible, and the system will
   * go idle during the delay, but will not start an other task. If it is not
   * possible to maintain your task for whatever reason (for example an isr
   * calls suspend on the task) an other task will run, but as soon as the
   * the original task is revived it will regain control when it was sleeping
   * or suspended. When you call a blocking function, it will lose the block,
   * which can be seen as an error. A dominant state may not be restarted
   * either.
   *
   * If a switching interrupt takes place during the time one of the tasks
   * is dominant, context will be saves and the interrupt is handled. Afterwards
   * the dominant task is restarted, even if, for example, the isr revived a
   * task with higher priority.
   *
   * If you call this on a task with shared stack, the task will become
   * dominant as long as the shared task is active.  Cancel the dominant
   * state before you restart. If you all the tasks have a shared stack,
   * the dominant state is without meaning and should not be used.
   *
   * Regarding file system operations the following applies. Opening a file
   * cannot be done while in dominant mode, since other tasks may hold a
   * write lock on the file system so it may block. If only one task is using
   * the file system (defined through the capabilities), blocking on file open
   * cannot occur, and opening a file in dominant mode is allowed.
   * After opening, you may switch on the dominant mode, for all subsequent
   * file operations. All possible write blocks on the file system are handled
   * by spin locks, since their release do not depend on other tasks to act.

     * This method is not a regular method but a define, to be as quick as possible.
     * It is assumed to compiler is able to compile it into a single bit-write instruction
     * (avr). If this is not possible, be sure you only call it when interrupts are
     * disabled, usually from an isr. GCC is able to compile this into an atomic instruction
     * for the AVR provided you supply a constant, or if you use the isrFireEventOnName() call,
     * and the register devAuxEventReg is the lowest I/O section (0x00-0x1F).  So you should
     * not call it with a variable. If you need to fire more events, call this function several
     * times, once for each event. Note that this call is never traced.
     *
     * A specialty of this method is that it can be utilized on the AVR within naked signal
     * handlers without any register saving, provided it compiles to an atomic instruction.
     * This makes interrupt handling extremely fast. Just release some task and go on. The
     * interrupt handles does not need to contain more that two instructions.
     *
     * Merely firing an event does not require the task to have event capabilities, it is
     * even more efficient when the task does not include the capabilities. Waiting for an
     * event however does.
     *
     * If you obtain a "left shift count is negative" from the compiler upon your call
     * you have used an invalid event number, less than zero, bigger then 7 or equal to
     * the AuxRegBit of the Femto OS (the registers for events and the Femto OS auxiliary
     * register may be shared, but in that case you may not use the one bit Femto OS
     * needs). Please correct the situation and do not ignore it just because it is a
     * only warning.
