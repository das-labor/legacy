 * are compared with the byte. In theory it is possible that a register

 * and set StackSafety to 4, it will report an error as soon as it detects
 * values are pushed onto the stack beyond 14 bytes. The task will then

 * but if you set it to some (small) positive value, this increases the
 * chance the check method catches an error before some the buggy behavior.
 *
 * When your code is finished, and runs bug free for some time, then set

 * take into consideration.
 * -- Two nested calls are necessary to reach the saveContext, thus the minimum
 *    value is 4 bytes, or whatever that takes on you architecture, even if you
 *    save nothing on the stack. Two of these bytes are removed again, the

 * -- Interrupts are disabled after the first call, so if you yield manually
 *    there is a slim (but non zero chance) the timer interrupt comes just after
 *    the call, and from that point on, 4 bytes are the minimum again, so with
 *    manual yielding, blocking delaying etc, add two bytes to your calculation.
 *    This risk is absent when the task run's 'forever', and is only switched
 *    at a timer interrupt.
 * -- You need one byte for the status register.
 * -- You need 4 bytes per group of 4 registers saved on the context
 * -- If you use any non switching calls to the OS, they usually disable interrupts
 *    after the (nested) call. If the function takes parameters, they are usually
 *    pushed on the stack in between. Count one byte per eight bit parameter.
 * -- Count your own nested calls!
 * -- Note that the testing the Femto OS performs for you only takes account
 *    of the regular depth encountered. However, in real life eventually all
 *    instructions  will be subject to an interrupt / context switch sometime.
 *    Also those you did not encountered on you lab table. Thus, the weird behavior
 *    may start weeks after you installed everything. Beware!
 * -- Have a look at the assembler code! Even if you don't really understand
 *    what is happening inside, calculating the stack depth is relatively easy.
 *    Certainly you know the depth a some locations.
 *
 * There is no need to remove unused parameters, if you deactivate the task, the
 * stack is automatically excluded.
 *
 * If all StackSize values are below 256, i.e. fit in one byte, only one byte
 * is used per task to store the stack level at context switch. Stacks may be larger
 * as 255 bytes however. 32767 at maximum.. In that case two bytes are needed per task to store

 * Specify the size of each slot stack per task.
 *

 * determine how many slots you need, and how much space this will take, you
 * must realize the following:
 * -- A slot can be locked or blocked by a task, or both. Every time a task
 *    locks a slot 4 bits are needed to store the slo tvalue. Two locks occupy
 *    one byte. Nesting of a synchronization primitive is realized by locking
 *    the same slot multiple times.
 * -- Locks are internally stored in the so called slot stack. The slot stack
 *    may contain free locks (i.e. not blocked) only or may hold blocking slots.
 *    A task can block on two slots at most, which are always stored at the
 *    bottom of the stack.
 * -- The mode in which the synchronization is placed determines how the
 * slot stack is understood. The possible modes are: cfgSyncNon,
 * cfgSyncSingleSlot, cfgSyncSingleBlock and cfgSyncDoubleBlock.
 *
 * See also the explanation at cfgUseSynchronization.
 * -- cfgSyncNon:         No slots can be used, it makes no sense to define
 *                        space for them. Set all values below to 0.
 * -- cfgSyncSingleSlot:  Only one slot per task is utilized. Values below
 *                        can be 0 or 1. One byte is occupied for every task
 *                        that makes use of a slot.
 * -- cfgSyncSingleBlock: Every task may only block on one slot, but may hold
 *                        one or more non blocking slots. Specify as many slots
 *                        as you need. The number of free slots the total
 *                        number, or the total minus one if a block is used.
 *                        The minimum number of slots in this case is 2,
 *                        (requires 1 byte)
 * --cfgSyncDoubleBlock:  Every task may block on one or two slots, and may
 *                        hold one or more non blocking slots. Specify as many
 *                        slots as you need. The number of free slots the total
 *                        number, or the total minus two if blocks are used.
 *                        Since in this situation, even in case a single block
 *                        is used, two slot places are reserved, no free locks
 *                        are possible any more. Thus the minimum for this option
 *                        is 4 slots (requiring 2 bytes)
 *
 * There does not exist a memory difference between 3 and 4 slots, or 5 and 6
 * slots. So you made round up to the next even number (except in case of one slot)
 * Tasks that do not need slots get a 0. Note the every nesting for the same
 * slot counts as one, so if you use a lock and reenter it in the same task, that
 * task needs two slots. Please note that any task that makes use of the file
 * system need at least one. At the moment the size maximum is 14 (allowing
 * for 14 simultaneous slots.
 *
 * Important: The preprocessor can generate much shorter code when all tasks
 * that use slots have the same size. So, besides 0 use one other size if
 * possible. Of course, you must weight that against the use of ram.

/** <!--1-->
 * Below you can parameterize the file system, if you need one. This is a
 * very basic file system defined on the local EEPROM or alike. Femto OS
 * protects the EEPROM from simultaneous access and has a multiple read,
 * single write synchronizer inside. However, if you large write files in
 * parts, so that you need multiple access to the write functions you need
 * to protect access in between yourself using mutexes. YOu can of course also
 * keep the file open while writing the parts.
 *
 * All files have compile time names (like the tasks) and compile time maximal
 * lengths. Thus the whole format of the storage space is known at compile
 * time. Fragmentation is not possible.
 * Note that if you change any of the parameters below, an already present
 * FS becomes corrupted and must be reformatted. (Simply whipe the EEPROM
 * at flash time).
 *
 * The FS can also get corrupted because of two other reasons.
 *
 * First, if the power goes down while the EEPROM is in a write cycle the CPU
 * might not complete writing the last byte. Since the Femto OS cannot protect
 * you from such a situation, you must take specific hardware measures. For example,
 * activate the brownout detector, so that the device will know it has to complete
 * quickly. Normally that should prevent you from bytes that where written
 * incorrectly.
 *
 * Second, your application might crash, the power might go down or there is
 * some other source of problems. In that case, although whole bytes are
 * written, the byte sequence might not completely be written, leading to
 * corrupt files. Therefore the FS first virtually erases each file, makes
 * the modifications, and than restores the access in the FAT. Since the
 * access specifier in the FAT is one byte, we can be sure it will be written
 * entirely (in which case the file was written correctly) or will not be
 * written at all, in which case the file will be lost. In any case integrity
 * of the FAT will be preserved. Note that if you write a file in parts, you're
 * file may not be completed in the view of your application. The file itself
 * will be valid at all times.
 *
 * To enhance the lifetime of the EEPROM, the FS does only erase a byte when
 * needed. In other words, if a byte can be written without erasing, this is done.
 * Of course the implies reading every byte prior to writing. (This behavior
 * can be changed by changing the port code)
 */

/** <!--1905-->
 * Specify the file names.
 *
 * Files are numbered internally, but can be given names, just like the tasks.
 * Only the first 16 files can have such a names. The rest of the file space
 * is divided into anonymous files of default length.
 * Handle the files using their names in the OnName methods. If the number
 * of a particular named file is needed use preFileNumberOf([FileName]) instead
 * of directly specifying the number, which may be due to change.
