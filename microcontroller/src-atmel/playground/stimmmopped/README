This is the scoure-code of the optical guitar and bass tuner called
Stimmmoppet.

Please see our wiki: 
http://www.das-labor.org/wiki/Stimmmopped/en
or
http://www.das-labor.org/wiki/Stimmmopped (for the german version)

In the folder eagle you find the layout and the shematics.
I used the free version of eagle.

How it functions:  (TODO translate)
===================================

This tool assists you in tuning your string instrument to a given tone. It utilizes the 
stroboscopic effect to give feedback about the adjustment of your instrument. The two LEDs on 
the board blink with the frequency that the chosen tone has. When the string vibrates with the 
correct frequency, two lines are projected at a fixed position on the string. If frequencies 
don't match, the lines appear to be blinking or moving to the observer's eye. The moving or 
blinking effect decreases with decreasing difference between the two frequencies.

Compiling:
==========

If you don´t want to compile the projekt use the precompiled 
hexfiled. 

Otherwise you need avr-gcc >=3.4.6

just type 

make 		          for the atmega48 or
make -f Makefile.m88  for the atmega88
 
to compile.

Getting the Firmware in to the microcontroller:
===============================================

The first time you programm your microcontroller you have to fuse the controller.

Low-Fuse      = 0xf7
High-Fuse     = 0xdf
Extended-Fuse = 0xf9

If you use avrdude add following parameters:

-U lfuse:w:0xf7:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U efuse:w:0xf9:m

For example:

avrdude -c usbasb -p m48 -U lfuse:w:0xf7:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U efuse:w:0xf9:m
avrdude -c usbasb -p m88 -U lfuse:w:0xf7:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U efuse:w:0xf9:m

(Don´t forget the jumper for the slowspeedmode on usbasb.)

For both processors there are precompiled hexfiles available.

You can progamm it with avrdude with following command:

avrdude -c usbasb -p m48 -U flash:w:stimmopped_m48.hex
avrdude -c usbasb -p m88 -U flash:w:stimmopped_m88.hex

Using the Simmmoppet:
=====================
Menu

Switch S1 (right): is used for switching between instument notes and instument chooser menu.

The instument chooser menu is displayed brighter. You can change the current instument with
switch S2 (left). The following programmed instuments are available:

b  bass (5 strings and also droped)
+--> with notes b0 (string 5), d1 (string 4 droped), E1 (sting 4), A1 (string 3), 
                d2 (string 2), G2 (string 1)
b. Bass (5 strings and also droped) half step down
+--> with notes A#0 (string 5), C#1 (string 4 droped), d#1 (string 4), G#1 (string 3), 
                C#2 (string 2), F#2 (string 1)
G  Guitar (also dorped)
+--> with notes d2 (string 6 droped), E2 (string 6), A2 (string 5), d3 (string 4), 
                G3 (string 3), b3 (string 2), E4 (string 1)
G. Guitar (also dorped) half step down
+--> with notes C#2 (string 6 droped), d#2 (string 6), G#2 (Sstringaite 5), C#3 (string 4), 
                F#3 (string 3), A#3 (string 2), d#4 (string 1)

Through S1 you can switch to the instument notes and the first note of the table is showen.
On the display now the notename and the octave in a switching cycle showen.

Just plug the corresponding string at the postion 12 and tune the sting. if the lines are still
its tuned.

Switch the note through S2.

After 30 secounds of not touching a switch. The device is going into power safe mode.

You can turn it on and off throuch touching S1 for more than 2 secounds.
