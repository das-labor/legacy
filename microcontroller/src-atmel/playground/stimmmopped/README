just type make for compile.

Unfortunatially i found out the on avr-gcc-4.3.0 the program compiles but not runs. On my old Version avr-gcc-3.4.6 runs.

If avr-gcc-3.4.6 is not the current version, use avr-gcc-select or  

export MCU_CC=avr-gcc-3.4.6; make 

In the folder eagle you find the layout and the shematics.
I used the free version of eagle.
