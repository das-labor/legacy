hansi:
(please don't do this, I've got a plan)
beautify & repair feature modes from rfm12_extra.*
improve buffer management (see fixmes)

whoever wants to do this:
add more livectrl functions



DO MORE THOROUGH BURN-IN TESTS
we need at least three devices
one transmitting only, one receiving only, one changing modes
this test shall see if switching to tx mode during heavy rx activity
it might be possible that we'll end up in strange states
