USING THIS LIBRARY
===================


1) Set up the correct Pins & Ports in rfm12_config.h

2) Use rfm_init_{rx,tx} to set either sending or receiving
mode

3) send data via rfm_tx(byte) or rfm_tx_wait (byte) (recommended)
and don't forget to error-check them.


For sending raw (configuration) data, use rfm_spi_send() (not recommended.)
