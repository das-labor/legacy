rtl/      -- The actual memory controller.

bench/    -- Components used in test benches. Used for both, simulation
             targets and real hardware targets.

sim/      -- Components used only by simulation targets. 
             (for example a DDR memory model or FPGA on-chip components
              like the DCM)

boards/*  -- Contains a subdirectory for each supported board. Each 
             directory contains a top level component in the file 
             "system.v".  The file system_sim.v is a simulation 
             testbench instantiating a system and a model of a 
             Micron DDR DRAM chip.

I'd be happy to hear from you if you use this component in one of your
projects.  Joerg Bornschein, <jb@capsec.org>
