RSS-Shuffle


ABOUT: 

This php regex-orgy shuffles through the content of a given set of rss feeds. 
The intended use was something screensaverlike via a browser and xscreensaver, as there is
NO single program out there, that just does this. 
Come on, is it that extraordinary wanting to watch the full content of some rss feeds  on 
your screenwhile your computer is idle?


CONFIGURATION:

Not that much. Make config.inc.php fit to your needs by setting your feeds, 
the pagetitle and the refresh time.


PROBLEMS:

At the moment we still encounter problems with sites having a absolute link to their stylesheet.
'Bullshit' you might think, the other way round should be problematic. No. The script was
primarily targeted on pixelpost, which uses relative one and slashdot, which uses none :)
As we testet it with wordpress, which links absolutely, we get something like
http://wordpressblog/template/css/http://wordpressblog/template/css/style.css
instead of just http://wordpressblog/template/css/style.css

If you like, think of a fast(!) solution.
