 *    - All feature #defines are now of the form FEATURE_xxx
 *    - Permanently turned off WIN_GUI_EDIT
 *    - Permanently turned on WEBDAV and SPLIT_PROXY_ARGS
 *
 *    Revision 1.9  2001/07/29 18:43:08  jongfoster
 *    Changing #ifdef _FILENAME_H to FILENAME_H_INCLUDED, to conform to
 *    ANSI C rules.
 *
 *    Revision 1.8  2001/07/13 14:04:59  oes
 *    Removed all #ifdef PCRS
 *
 *    Revision 1.7  2001/06/07 23:08:12  jongfoster
 *    Forward and ACL edit options removed.
 *
 *    Revision 1.6  2001/05/31 21:37:11  jongfoster
 *    GUI changes to rename "permissions file" to "actions file".
 *
 *    Revision 1.5  2001/05/29 09:50:24  jongfoster
 *    Unified blocklist/imagelist/permissionslist.
 *    File format is still under discussion, but the internal changes
 *    are (mostly) done.
 *
 *    Also modified interceptor behaviour:
 *    - We now intercept all URLs beginning with one of the following
 *      prefixes (and *only* these prefixes):
 *        * http://i.j.b/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sf.net/config/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/
 *    - New interceptors "home page" - go to http://i.j.b/ to see it.
 *    - Internal changes so that intercepted and fast redirect pages
 *      are not replaced with an image.
 *    - Interceptors now have the option to send a binary page direct
 *      to the client. (i.e. ijb-send-banner uses this)
 *    - Implemented show-url-info interceptor.  (Which is why I needed
 *      the above interceptors changes - a typical URL is
 *      "http://i.j.b/show-url-info?url=www.somesite.com/banner.gif".
 *      The previous mechanism would not have intercepted that, and
 *      if it had been intercepted then it then it would have replaced
 *      it with an image.)
 *
 *    Revision 1.4  2001/05/26 01:26:34  jongfoster
 *    New #define, WIN_GUI_EDIT, enables the (embryonic) Win32 GUI editor.
 *    This #define cannot be set from ./configure - there's no point, it
 *    doesn't work yet.  See feature request # 425722
 *
 *    Revision 1.3  2001/05/26 00:28:36  jongfoster
 *    Automatic reloading of config file.
 *    Removed obsolete SIGHUP support (Unix) and Reload menu option (Win32).
 *    Most of the global variables have been moved to a new
 *    struct configuration_spec, accessed through csp->config->globalname
 *    Most of the globals remaining are used by the Win32 GUI.
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/05/20 01:21:20  jongfoster
 *    Version 2.9.4 checkin.
 *    - Merged popupfile and cookiefile, and added control over PCRS
 *      filtering, in new "permissionsfile".
 *    - Implemented LOG_LEVEL_FATAL, so that if there is a configuration
 *      file error you now get a message box (in the Win32 GUI) rather
 *      than the program exiting with no explanation.
 *    - Made killpopup use the PCRS MIME-type checking and HTTP-header
 *      skipping.
 *    - Removed tabs from "config"
 *    - Moved duplicated url parsing code in "loaders.c" to a new funcition.
 *    - Bumped up version number.
