 *
 * Revisions   :
 *    $Log: list.h,v $
 *    Revision 1.12.2.1  2002/11/28 18:14:54  oes
 *    Added unmap function that removes all items with a given
 *    name from a map.
 *
 *    Revision 1.12  2002/03/26 22:29:55  swa
 *    we have a new homepage!
 *
 *    Revision 1.11  2002/03/24 13:25:43  swa
 *    name change related issues
 *
 *    Revision 1.10  2002/03/07 03:46:17  oes
 *    Fixed compiler warnings
 *
 *    Revision 1.9  2001/10/23 21:21:03  jongfoster
 *    New error handling - error codes are now jb_errs, not ints.
 *    Changed the way map() handles out-of-memory, to dramatically
 *    reduce the amount of error-checking clutter needed.
 *
 *    Revision 1.8  2001/09/16 17:30:24  jongfoster
 *    Fixing a compiler warning.
 *
 *    Revision 1.7  2001/09/16 13:20:29  jongfoster
 *    Rewrite of list library.  Now has seperate header and list_entry
 *    structures.  Also added a large sprinking of assert()s to the list
 *    code.
 *
 *    Revision 1.6  2001/08/05 16:06:20  jongfoster
 *    Modifiying "struct map" so that there are now separate header and
 *    "map_entry" structures.  This means that functions which modify a
 *    map no longer need to return a pointer to the modified map.
 *    Also, it no longer reverses the order of the entries (which may be
 *    important with some advanced template substitutions).
 *
 *    Revision 1.5  2001/07/29 18:43:08  jongfoster
 *    Changing #ifdef _FILENAME_H to FILENAME_H_INCLUDED, to conform to
 *    ANSI C rules.
 *
 *    Revision 1.4  2001/06/29 13:30:37  oes
 *    - Introduced enlist_unique_header()
 *    - Removed logentry from cancelled commit
 *
 *    Revision 1.3  2001/06/03 11:03:48  oes
 *    introduced functions for new list type "map": map(), lookup(),
 *    free_map(), and extended enlist_unique
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/06/01 18:49:17  jongfoster
 *    Replaced "list_share" with "list" - the tiny memory gain was not
 *    worth the extra complexity.
 *
 *    Revision 1.1  2001/05/31 21:11:53  jongfoster
 *    - Moved linked list support to new "list.c" file.
 *      Structure definitions are still in project.h,
 *      function prototypes are now in "list.h".
 *    - Added support for "struct list_share", which is identical
 *      to "struct list" except it saves memory by not duplicating
 *      the strings.  Obviously, this only works if there is some
 *      other way of managing the memory used by the strings.
 *      (These list_share lists are used for lists which last
 *      for only 1 request, and where all the list entries are
 *      just coming directly from entries in the actionsfile.)
 *      Note that you still need to destroy list_share lists
 *      properly to free the nodes - it's only the strings
 *      which are shared.
