<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> is the 
 <quote><emphasis>Privacy Enhancing Proxy</emphasis></quote>. Also, its content
 modification and junk suppression allow you to browse your
 <quote><emphasis>private</emphasis> edition</quote> of the web.
</para>
<para>
 <ulink url="http://junkbusters.com/">Junkbusters Corporation</ulink>
 continues to offer their original version of the <application>Internet
 Junkbuster</application>, so publishing our
 <application> Junkbuster</application>-derived software under the same name
 led to confusion.
</para>
<para>
 There are also potential legal complications from the continued use of the 
 <application>Junkbuster</application> name, which is a registered trademark of 
 <ulink url="http://junkbusters.com/">Junkbusters Corporation</ulink>.
 There are, however, no objections from Junkbusters Corporation to the 
 <application>Privoxy</application> project itself, and they, in fact, still
 share our ideals and goals.
</para>
<para>
 The developers also believed that there are so many changes from the original 
 code, that it was time to make a clean break from the past and make 
 a name in their own right<![%p-not-stable;[, especially now with the pending
 release of version 3.0]]>.
</para>
</sect2>


<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="differs"><title>How does <application>Privoxy</application> differ
from the old <application>Junkbuster?</application></title> 
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> picks up where
 <application>Junkbuster</application> left off. All the old features remain.
 The new <application>Privoxy</application> still blocks ads and banners,
 still manages cookies, and still helps protect your privacy. But, these are
 all enhanced, and many new features have been added, all in the same vein.
 </para>
 <para>
 The configuration has changed significantly as well. This is something that
 users will notice right off the bat if upgrading from 
 <application>Junkbuster</application> 2.0.x. The <quote>blocklist</quote>
 <quote>cookielist</quote>, <quote>imagelist</quote> and much more has been
 combined into the <quote>actions</quote> files, with a completely different
 syntax. See the <ulink url="../user-manual/upgradersnote.html">note to
 upgraders</ulink> for  details.

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="proxymoron"><title>What is a <quote>proxy</quote>? How does
<application>Privoxy</application> work? </title>
 <para>
  A web proxy is a service, based on a software such as <application>Privoxy</application>,
  that clients (i.e. browsers) can use instead of connecting directly to the web
  servers on the Internet. The clients then ask the proxy to fetch the objects
  they need (web pages, images, movies etc) on their behalf, and when the proxy
  has done so, it hands the results back to the client.
 </para>
 <para>
  There are many reasons to use web proxies, such as security (firewalling),
  efficiency (caching) and others, and there are just as many different proxies
  to accommodate those needs.
 </para>
 <para>
  <application>Privoxy</application> is a proxy that is solely focused on privacy
  protection and junk elimination. Sitting between your browser(s) and the Internet,
  it is in a perfect position to filter outbound personal information that your
  browser is leaking, as well as inbound junk. It uses a variety of techniques to do
  this, all of which are under your control via the various configuration
  files and options.
 </para>
</sect2>


<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="whatsanad">
<title id="knows">How does <application>Privoxy</application> know what is
an ad, and what is not?</title>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application>'s approach to blocking ads is twofold:
</para>
<para>
 First, there are certain patterns in the <emphasis>locations</emphasis> (URLs)
 of banner images. This applies to both the path (you wouldn't guess how many
 web sites serve their banners from a directory called <quote>banners</quote>!)
 and the host (blocking the big banner hosting services like doublecklick.net
 already helps a lot). <application>Privoxy</application> takes advantage of this
 fact by using <ulink url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#AF-PATTERNS">URL
 patterns</ulink> to sort out and block the requests for banners.
</para>
<para>
 Second, banners tend to come in certain <emphasis>sizes</emphasis>. But you
 can't tell the size of an image by its URL without downloading it, and if you
 do, it's too late to save bandwidth. Therefore, <application>Privoxy</application>
 also inspects the HTML sources of web pages while they are loaded, and replaces
 references to images with standard banner sizes by dummy references, so that
 your browser doesn't request them anymore in the first place.
</para>
<para>
 Both of this involves a certain amount of guesswork and is, of course, freely
 configurable.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="mistakes">Can <application>Privoxy</application> make mistakes? 
This does not sound very scientific.</title>
<para>
 Actually, it's a black art ;-) And yes, it is always possible to have a broad
 rule accidentally block or change something by mistake. You will almost surely
 run into such situations at some point. It is tricky writing rules to
 cover every conceivable possibility, and not occasionally get false positives.
</para>

<para>
 But this should not be a big concern since the
 <application>Privoxy</application> configuration is very flexible, and
 includes tools to help identify these types of situations so they can be
 addressed as needed, allowing you to customize your installation.
 (<link linkend="badsite">See the Troubleshooting section below</link>.)
</para>

</sect2>


<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="configornot">Will I have to configure <application>Privoxy</application>
 before I can use it?</title>
<para>
 No, not really. The default installation should give you a good starting
 point, and block <emphasis>most</emphasis> unwanted content.
</para>
<para>
 But you will certainly run into situations where there are false positives,
 or ads not being blocked that you may not want to see. In these cases, you
 would certainly benefit by customizing <application>Privoxy's</application>
 configuration to more closely match your individual situation. And we would
 encourage you to do this. This is where the real power of
 <application>Privoxy</application> lies!
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="browsers2"><title>My browser does the same things as
<application>Privoxy</application>. Why should I use
<application>Privoxy</application> at all?</title>
 <para>
  Modern browsers do indeed have <emphasis>some</emphasis> of the same
  functionality as <application>Privoxy</application>. Maybe this is
  adequate for you. But <application>Privoxy</application> is much more
  versatile and powerful, and can do a number of things that browsers just can't.
 </para>
 <para>
  In addition, a proxy is good choice if you use multiple browsers, or 
  have a LAN with multiple computers. This way all the configuration 
  is in one place, and you don't have to maintain a similar configuration 
  for possibly many browsers.
 </para>
</sect2>



<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="license"><title>Is there is a license or fee? What about a 
warranty? Registration?</title>
 <para>
  <application>Privoxy</application> is licensed under the <ulink
  url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</ulink>.
  It is free to use, copy, modify or distribute as you wish under the terms of this
  license.  Please see the <link linkend="copyright">Copyright</link> section for more
  information on the license and copyright. Or the <filename>LICENSE</filename> file 
  that should be included.
 </para>
 <para>
  There is <emphasis>no warranty</emphasis> of any kind, expressed, implied or otherwise.
  That is something that would cost real money ;-) There is no registration either.
  <application>Privoxy</application> really is <emphasis>free</emphasis>
  in every respect!
 </para>

<sect3 renderas="sect4" id="jointeam-money"><title>Money Money Money</title>
<para>
 We, of course, welcome donations and could use money for domain registering,
 buying software to test <application>Privoxy</application> with, and, of course,

 If you are a vendor of a web-related software like a browser, web server
 or proxy, and would like us to ensure that <application>Privoxy</application>
 runs smoothly with your product, you might consider supplying us with a
 copy or license. We can't, however, guarantee that we will fix all potential
 compatibility issues as a result.

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="whichbrowsers">
<title>Which browsers are supported by <application>Privoxy</application>?</title>
<para>
 Any browser that can be configured to use a proxy, which 
 should be virtually all browsers. Direct browser support is not necessary
 since <application>Privoxy</application> runs as a separate application and
 talks to the browser in the standardized HTTP protocol, just like a web server
 does.

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="email-client">
<title>Can I use <application>Privoxy</application> with my email client?</title>
<para>
 As long as there is some way to set a HTTP proxy for the client, then yes,
 any application can be used, whether it is strictly speaking a
 <quote>browser</quote> or not. Though this may not be the best approach for
 dealing with some of the common abuses of HTML in email. See <link
 linkend="outlook">How can I configure <application>Privoxy</application>
 with <application>Outlook Express</application>?</link> below for more on
 this. 
</para>
<para>
 Be aware that HTML email presents a number of unique security and privacy
 related issues, that can require advanced skills to overcome. The developers
 recommend using email clients that can be configured to convert HTML to plain
 text for these reasons.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="newinstall"><title>Can I install  
 <application>Privoxy</application> over <application>Junkbuster</application>?</title>
 <para>
   We recommend you un-install <application>Junkbuster</application>
   first to minimize conflicts and confusion. You may want to 
   save your old configuration files for future reference. The configuration
   files and syntax have substantially changed, so you will need to manually
   port your old patterns. See the <ulink url="../user-manual/upgradersnote.html">note
   to upgraders</ulink> and <ulink url="../user-manual/installation.html">installation
   chapter</ulink> in the <ulink url="../user-manual/index.html">user manual</ulink>
   for details.
 </para>
 <para>
  Note: Some installers may automatically un-install
  <application>Junkbuster</application>, if present!
 </para>

</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="firststep">I just installed <application>Privoxy</application>. Is there anything 
special I have to do now?</title>

<para>
 All browsers must be told to use <application>Privoxy</application> 
 as a proxy by specifying the correct proxy address and port number 
 in the appropriate configuration area for the browser. See below.
 You should also flush your browser's memory and disk cache to get rid of any
 cached junk items, and remove any stored cookies.

</para>

</sect2>


<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="localhost"><title>What is the proxy address of <application>Privoxy</application>?</title>
 <para>
  If you set up the <application>Privoxy</application> to run on
  the computer you browse from (rather than your ISP's server or some
  networked computer on a LAN), the proxy will be on <literal>127.0.0.1</literal> 
  (sometimes referred to as <quote>localhost</quote>,
  which is the special name used by every computer on the Internet to refer
  to itself) and the port will be 8118 (unless you have <application>Privoxy</application>
  to run on a different port with the <ulink
  url="../user-manual/config.html#LISTEN-ADDRESS">listen-address</ulink> config option). 
 </para>
 <para>
  When configuring your browser's proxy settings you typically enter
  the word <quote>localhost</quote> or the IP address <quote>127.0.0.1</quote>
  in the boxes next to <quote>HTTP</quote> and <quote>Secure</quote> (HTTPS) and
  then the number <quote>8118</quote> for <quote>port</quote>. 
  This tells your browser to send all web requests to <application>Privoxy</application>
  instead of directly to the Internet.
 </para>
 <para>
  <application>Privoxy</application> can also be used to proxy for 
  a Local Area Network. In this case, your would enter either the IP 
  address of the LAN host where <application>Privoxy</application> 
  is running, or the equivalent hostname. Port assignment would be 
  same as above. Note that <application>Privoxy</application> doesn't
  listen on any LAN interfaces by default.
 </para>
 <para>
  <application>Privoxy</application> does not currently handle
  any other protocols such as FTP, SMTP, IM, IRC, ICQ, etc. 
 </para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="nothing">
<title>I just installed <application>Privoxy</application>, and nothing is happening.
All the ads are there. What's wrong?</title>

<para>
 Did you configure your browser to use <application>Privoxy</application> 
 as a proxy? It does not sound like it. See above. You might also try flushing
 the browser's caches to force a full re-reading of pages. You can verify 
 that <application>Privoxy</application> is running, and your browser 
 is correctly configured by entering the special URL: 
 <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink>. 
 <!-- Use http://p.p/ instead of http://config.privoxy.org/ here because
      of potential redirect caching problem (see next Q). -->
 This should take you to a page titled <quote>This is Privoxy..</quote> with
 access to <application>Privoxy's</application> internal configuration.
 If you see this, then you are good to go. If you receive a page saying 
 <quote>Privoxy is not running</quote>, then the browser is not set up to use
 your <application>Privoxy</application> installation.
 If you receive anything else (probably nothing at all), it could either
 be that the browser is not set up correctly, or that
 <application>Privoxy</application> is not running at all. Check the <ulink
 url="../user-manual/config.html#LOGFILE">log file</ulink>. For instructions
 on starting <application>Privoxy</application> and browser configuration,
 see the <ulink url="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/startup.html">chapter
 on starting <application>Privoxy</application></ulink> in the
 <ulink url="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/">user manual</ulink>.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="notused">
<title>I get a <quote>Privoxy is not being used</quote> dummy page although
<application>Privoxy</application> is running and being used.</title>

<para>
 First, make sure that Privoxy is <emphasis>really</emphasis> running and
 being used by visiting <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink>. You
 should see the <application>Privoxy</application> main page. If not, see
 the <ulink url="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/startup.html">chapter
 on starting <application>Privoxy</application></ulink> in the
 <ulink url="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/">user manual</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
 Now if <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink> works for you, but
 other parts of <application>Privoxy</application>'s web interface show
 the dummy page, your browser has cached a redirection it encountered before
 <application>Privoxy</application> was being used. You need to clear your
 browser's cache. Note that shift-reloading the dummy page won't help, since
 that'll only refresh the dummy page, not the redirection that lead you there.
</para>

<para>
 The procedure for clearing the cache varies from browser to browser. As an
 example, <application>Mozilla</application> users would click 
 <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> --> <guibutton>Preferences</guibutton> -->
 <guibutton>Advanced</guibutton> --> <guibutton>Cache</guibutton> and
 then click both <quote><guibutton>Clear Memory Cache</guibutton></quote>
 and <quote><guibutton>Clear Disk Cache</guibutton></quote>.

 <para>
   The syntax, number, and purpose of configuration files has substantially

   of <application>Privoxy</application>. The old files, like <filename>blocklist</filename>
   will not work at all. If you are upgrading from a 2.0.x version, you will
   need to port your configuration data to the new format. Note that even the
   pattern syntax has changed! Even configuration files from the 2.9.x versions
   will need to be adapted, as configuration syntax has been very much in flow
   in the 2.9.x series.

<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="actionsfile">What is an <quote>actions</quote> file?</title>

<para>
 <ulink url="../user-manual/actions-file.html">Actions files</ulink>
 are where various <ulink url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#ACTIONS">actions</ulink>
 that <application>Privoxy</application> might take while processing a certain

 that apply to all URLs, then add exceptions to these defaults where needed.
</para>
 
<para>
 Actions can be defined on a <ulink

 for single URLs, whole web sites, groups or parts thereof etc. Actions can also be
 grouped together and then applied to requests matching one or more patterns.
 There are many possible actions that might apply to any given site. As an example,
 if you are blocking cookies as one of your default actions, but need to accept
 cookies from a given site, you would need to define an exception for this
 site in one of your actions files, preferably in <filename>user.action</filename>.

  Configuring <application>Privoxy</application> is not entirely trivial. To

 </para>

<para>
 Where the defaults are likely to break some sites, exceptions for
 known popular <quote>problem</quote> sites are included, but in

 you will have to make later. See the <ulink

  It may seem strange that regular users can edit the config files with their

  belongs to the user <quote>privoxy</quote>, with only 644 permissions.
 </para>
 <para>
  When you use the browser-based editor, <application>Privoxy</application>

  it can update the config files.
 </para>
 <para>
  If you run <application>Privoxy</application> for multiple untrusted users (e.g. in

<para>
 The <ulink url="../user-manual/filter-file.html"><filename>default.filter</filename></ulink>

 remove, web page content on the fly. Filters apply to <emphasis>anything</emphasis>
 in the page source, including HTML tags, and JavaScript. Regular expressions are used
 to accomplish this. There are a number of pre-defined filters to deal with common

<para>
 If you are familiar with regular expressions, and HTML, you can look at

<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="blockedisugly">I see large red banners on some pages that say 
<quote>Blocked</quote>. Why and how do I get rid of this?</title>
<para>
 These are URLs that match something in one of 
 <application>Privoxy's</application> block actions 
 (<ulink
 url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#BLOCK"><quote>+block</quote></ulink>).
 It is meant to be a warning so that you know something has been blocked and
 an easy way for you to see why. These are handled differently than what has
 been defined explicitly as <quote>images</quote> (e.g. ads that are GIF image
 files). Depending on the URL itself, it is sometimes hard for
 <application>Privoxy</application> to really know whether there is indeed an
 ad image there or not. And there are limitations as to what
 <application>Privoxy</application> can do to <quote>fool</quote> the
 browser.
</para>

<para>
 For instance, if the ad is in a frame, then it is embedded in the separate
 HTML page used for the frame. In this case, you cannot just substitute an
 aribitrary image (like we would for a <quote>blank</quote> image), for an HTML
 page. The browser is expecting an HTML page, and that is what it must have
 for frames. Such situations can be a little trickier to deal with, and 
 <application>Privoxy</application> may show the <quote>Blocked</quote> page,
 despite your best efforts.
</para>

<para>
 If you want these to be treated as if they were images, so that they can be
 made invisible, you can try moving the offending URL from the
 <quote>+block</quote> section to the <quote>+imageblock</quote> section of
 your actions file. Just be forewarned, if any URL is made
 <quote>invisible</quote>, you may not have any inkling that something has
 been removed from that page, or why. If this approach does not work, then you are
 probably dealing with a frame (or <quote>ilayer</quote>), and the only thing
 that can go there is an HTML page of some sort.
</para>
<para>
 To deal with this situation, you could modify the
 <quote><filename>block</filename></quote> HTML template that is used by
 <application>Privoxy</application> to display this, and make it something
 more to your liking. Currently, there is no configuration option for this.
 You will have to modify, or create your own page, and use this to replace
 <filename>templates/blocked</filename>, which is what
 <application>Privoxy</application> uses to display the <quote>Blocked</quote>
 page.
</para>
<para>
 Another way to deal with this is find why and where
 <application>Privoxy</application> is blocking the frame, and 
 diable this. Then let the <quote>+set-image-blocker</quote> action 
 handle the ad that is embedded in the frame's HTML page. 
</para>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="alliseeisred">

 There is not enough available space to fit the entire Blocked page. Try right
 clicking on the visible portion, and select <quote>Show Frame</quote>,
 or equivalent. This will usually allow you to see the entire Privoxy
 <quote>Blocked</quote> page, and from there you can see just what is being
 blocked, and why.
</para>
<para>
 As of Privoxy 2.9.14, the Blocked banner page is re-sizeable, and tries
 to adjust to the allotted space. There may be occassions where there 
 just isn't enough room to display much of anything useful though.

<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="blockedbytext">I see some images being replaced by a text
instead of the checkerboard image. Why and how do I get rid of this?</title>
<para>
 This happens when the banners are not embedded in the HTML code of the
 page itself, but in separate HTML (sub)documents that are loaded into (i)frames
 or (i)layers, and these external HTML documents are blocked. Being non-images
 they get replaced by a substitute HTML page rather than a substitute image,
 which wouldn't work out technically, since the browser expects and accepts
 only HTML when it has requested an HTML document. 
</para>
<para>
 The substitute page adapts to the available space and shows itself as a
 miniature two-liner if loaded into small frames, or full-blown with a
 large red "BLOCKED" banner if space allows.
</para>
<para>
 If you prefer the banners to be blocked by images, you must see to it that
 the HTML documents in which they are embedded are not blocked. Clicking
 the <quote>See why</quote> link offered in the substitute page will show
 you which rule blocked the page. After changing the rule and un-blocking
 the HTML documents, the browser will try to load the actual banner images
 and the usual image blocking will (hopefully!) kick in.

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="outlook-more">

 The short answer is, you can't. <application>Privoxy</application> has no way
 of knowing which particular application makes a request, so there is no way to
 distinguish between web pages and HTML mail.
 <application>Privoxy</application> just blindly proxies all requests. In the
 case of <application>Outlook Express</application> (see above), OE uses 
 IE anyway, and there is no way for <application>Privoxy</application> to ever

 If you use any <literal><ulink

 such as filtering banners by size, web-bugs etc, or the <literal><ulink
 url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#DEANIMATE-GIFS">deanimate-gifs</ulink></literal>
 action, the entire document must be loaded into memory in order for the filtering 
 mechanism to work, and nothing is sent to the browser during this time.
</para>
<para>
 The loading time does not really change in real numbers, but the feeling is
 different, because most browsers are able to start rendering incomplete
 content, giving the user a feeling of "it works". This effect is especially
 noticeable on slow dialup connections.
 </para>
<para>
 Filtering is automatically disabled for inappropriate MIME types. But note 
 that if the web server mis-reports the MIME type, then content that should
 not be filtered, could be. <application>Privoxy</application> only knows how
 to differentiate filterable content because of the MIME type as reported by
 the server, or because of some configuration setting that enables/disables
 filtering.

 <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink> is a shortcut for it.

 Since <application>Privoxy</application> sits between your web browser and the Internet, 
 it can simply intercept requests for these addresses and answer them with its built-in

 This also makes for a good test for your browser configuration: If entering the

 If you get a page saying <quote>Privoxy is not working</quote> instead, then
 your browser didn't use <application>Privoxy</application> for the request,
 hence it could not be intercepted, and you have accessed the <emphasis>real</emphasis>
 web site at config.privoxy.org.

<para>

<para>
 If you run both the browser and the proxy locally, you cannot hide your IP

 server needs to know your IP address to send the answers back to you. 
</para>
<para>
 Fortunately there are many publicly usable anonymous proxies out there, which
 solve the problem by providing a further level of indirection between you and
 the web server, shared by many people, and thus letting your requests "drown"
 in white noise of unrelated requests as far as user tracking is concerned.
</para>
<para>
 Most of them will, however, log your IP address and make it available to the
 authorities in case you abuse that anonymity for criminal purposes. In fact
 you can't even rule out that some of them only exist to *collect* information
 on (those suspicious) people with a more than average preference for privacy.
</para>
<para>
 You can find a list of anonymous public proxies at <ulink

 more through Google. A particularly interesting project is the JAP service

<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="anonforsure">Can <application>Privoxy</application> guarantee I am anonymous?</title>

 No. Your chances of remaining anonymous are greatly improved, but unless you

 everything you do on the Web can be traced back to you.

<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> can remove various information about you,

 that web sites can find out who you are. Here's one way this can happen.
</para>
<para>
 A few browsers disclose the user's email address in certain situations, such
 as when transferring a file by FTP. <application>Privoxy</application>
 does not filter FTP. If you need this feature, or are concerned about the
 mail handler of your browser disclosing your email address, you might
 consider products such as <application>NSClean</application>.
</para>
<para>
 Browsers available only as binaries could use non-standard headers to give
 out any information they can have access to: see the manufacturer's license
 agreement. It's impossible to anticipate and prevent every breach of privacy
 that might occur. The professionally paranoid prefer browsers available as
 source code, because anticipating their behavior is easier. Trust the source,
 Luke!

<para>
 <quote>User-Agent</quote> in particular is often used in this way to identify
 the browser, and adjust content accordingly. Changing this now (at least not
 further than removing the OS information) is not recommended, since so many
 sites do look for it. You may get undesirable results by changing this.
</para>

<para>
 For instance, different browsers use different encodings of Russian and Czech
 characters, certain web servers convert pages on-the-fly according to the
 User Agent header. Giving a <quote>User Agent</quote> with the wrong
 operating system or browser manufacturer causes some sites in these languages
 to be garbled; Surfers to Eastern European sites should change it to
 something closer. And then some page access counters work by looking at the
 <quote>Referer</quote> header; they may fail or break if unavailable. The
 weather maps of Intellicast have been blocked by their server when no
 <quote>Referer</quote> or cookie is provided, is another example. (But you
 can forge both headers without giving information away). There are
 many other ways things can go wrong when trying to fool a web server.
</para>

<para>
 Similar thoughts apply to modifying JavaScript, and, to a lesser degree,
 HTML elements.
</para>

<para>
 If you have problems with a site, you will have to adjust your configuration 
 accordingly. Cookies are probably the most likely adjustment that may 
 be required, but by no means the only one.

<para>
 This is not a font problem. The logo is an image that is created by 
 <application>Privoxy</application> on the fly. So as to not waste

<title id="wasted">I have large empty spaces / a checkerboard pattern now where

<para>
 It would be technically possible eliminate the banners in a way that frees
 their screen estate in many cases, by doing all banner blocking with filters,
 i.e. eliminating the whole image references from the HTML pages instead
 of letting them stay in, and blocking the resulting requests for the
 banners themselves.
</para>
<para>
 But this would consume considerable CPU resources, would likely destroy
 the layout of many web pages which rely on the banners consuming a certain
 amount of screen space, and would fail in other cases, where the screen space
 is reserved e.g. by tables anyway. Also, making the banners disappear without
 a visual trace complicates troubleshooting.

 So we won't support this in the default configuration, but you can of course
 define appropriate filters yourself.

<para>
 Since secure HTTP connections are encrypted SSL sessions between your browser

 there is little that <application>Privoxy</application> can do but hand the raw
 gibberish data though from one end to the other unprocessed.
</para>
<para>
 The only exception to this is blocking by host patterns, as the client needs
 to tell <application>Privoxy</application> the name of the remote server,
 so that <application>Privoxy</application> can establish the connection.
 If that name matches a host-only pattern, the connection will be blocked.
</para>
<para>
 As far as ad blocking is concerned, this is less of a restriction than it may
 seem, since ad sources are often identifiable by the host name, and often
 the banners to be placed in an encrypted page come unencrypted nonetheless
 for efficiency reasons, which exposes them to the full power of

 There are no known exploits that might affect

 Internet in this configuration. If you want to have
 <application>Privoxy</application> serve as a LAN proxy, this will have to
 be opened up to allow for LAN requests. In this case, we'd recommend
 you specify only the LAN gateway address, e.g. 192.168.1.1, in the main 
 <application>Privoxy</application> configuration file and check all <ulink

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="downloads">
<title>Can <application>Privoxy</application> effect files that I download
from a webserver? FTP server?</title>
<para>
 From the webserver's perspective, there is no difference between
 viewing a document (i.e. a page), and downloading a file. The same is true of
 <application>Privoxy</application>. If there is a match for a <literal><ulink
 url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#BLOCK">block</ulink></literal> pattern,
 it will still be blocked, and of course this is obvious. 
 </para>
 <para>
 Filtering is potentially more of a concern since the results are not always
 so obvious, and the effects of filtering are there whether the file is simply
 viewed, or downloaded. And potentially whether the content is some obnoxious
 advertizement, or Mr. Jimmy's latest/greatest source code jewel. Of course,
 one of these presumably is <quote>bad</quote> content that we don't want, and
 the other is <quote>good</quote> content that we do want.
 <application>Privoxy</application> is blind to the differences, and can only
 distinguish <quote>good from bad</quote> by the configuration parameters
 <emphasis>we</emphasis> give it.
</para>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> knows the differences in files according
 to the <quote>Document Type</quote> as reported by the webserver. If this is
 reported accurately (e.g. <quote>application/zip</quote> for a zip archive),
 then <application>Privoxy</application> knows to ignore these where
 appropriate. <application>Privoxy</application> potentially can filter HTML
 as well as plain text documents, subject to configuration parameters of
 course. Also, documents that are of an unknown type (generally assumed to be
 <quote>text/plain</quote>) can be filtered, as will those that might be
 incorrectly reported by the webserver. If such a file is a downloaded file
 that is intended to be saved to disk, then any content that might have been
 altered by filtering, will be saved too, for these (probably rare) cases.
</para>
<para>
 Note that versions later than 3.0.2 do NOT filter document types of
 <quote>text/plain</quote>. Prior to this, <application>Privoxy</application>
 did filter this document type.
</para>
<para>
 In short, filtering is <quote>ON</quote> if a) the Document Type as reported
 by the webserver is appropriate <emphasis>and</emphasis> b) the configuration
 allows it (or at least does not disallow it). That's it. There is no magic
 cookie anywhere to say this is <quote>good</quote> and this is
 <quote>bad</quote>. It's the configuration that let's it all happen or not.
</para>
<para>
 If you download text files, you probably do not want these to be filtered,
 particularly if the content is source code, or other critical content. Source
 code sometimes might be mistaken for Javascript (i.e. the kind that might
 open a pop-up window). It is recommended to turn off filtering for download
 sites (particularly if the content may be plain text files and you are using
 version 3.0.2 or earlier) in your <filename>user.action</filename> file. And
 also, for any site or page where making <emphasis>any</emphasis> changes at
 all to the content is to be avoided.

 Alternately, if you are comfortable with a text editor, you can accomplish 
 the same thing by editing the appropriate actions file. Probably the easiest 
 way to deal with such problems when editing by hand is to add your
 site to a <literal>{ fragile }</literal> section in <filename>user.action</filename>,

<title>After installing <application>Privoxy</application>, I have to log in

<para>
 This is a quirk that effects the installation of
 <application>Privoxy</application>, in conjunction with Internet Explorer and
 Internet Connection Sharing on Windows 2000 and Windows XP. The symptoms may
 appear to be corrupted or invalid DUN settings, or passwords.
</para>

<para>
 When setting up an NT based Windows system with
 <application>Privoxy</application> you may find that things do not seem to be
 doing what you expect. When you set your system up you will probably have set
 up Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) with Dial up Networking (DUN) when
 logged in with administrator privileges. You will probably have made this DUN
 connection available to other accounts that you may have set-up on your
 system. E.g. Mum or Dad sets up the system and makes accounts suitably
 configured for the kids.
</para>

<para>
 When setting up <application>Privoxy</application> in this environment you
 will have to alter the proxy set-up of Internet Explorer (IE) for the
 specific DUN connection on which you wish to use
 <application>Privoxy</application>. When you do this the ICS DUN set-up
 becomes user specific. In this instance you will see no difference if you
 change the DUN connection under the account used to set-up the connection.
 However when you do this from another user you will notice that the DUN
 connection changes to make available to "Me only". You will also find that
 you have to store the password under each different user!
</para>

<para>
 The reason for this is that each user's set-up for IE is user specific. Each
 set-up DUN connection and each LAN connection in IE store the settings for
 each user individually. As such this enforces individual configurations
 rather than common ones. Hence the first time you use a DUN connection after
 re-booting your system it may not perform as you expect, and prompt you for 
 the password. Just set and save the password again and all should be OK.

 This may also be caused by the <quote>demoronizer</quote> filter, 
 in conjunction with a web server that is misreporting a file type. Binary 
 files are exempted from <application>Privoxy's</application> filtering
 (unless the web server by mistake says the file is a plain text file). Either
 upgrade <application>Privoxy</application>, or go to the most recent
 <filename>default.action</filename> file available from <ulink

<title>
 What is the <quote>demoronizer</quote> and why is it there?
</title>
<para>
 The original demoronizer was a Perl script that cleaned up HTML pages which 
 were created with certain Microsoft products. MS has used proprietary extensions 
 to standardized font encodings (ISO 8859-1), which has caused problems for pages
 that are viewed with non-Microsoft products (and are expecting to see a
 standard set of fonts). The demoronizer corrected these errors so the pages
 displayed correctly. <application>Privoxy</application> borrowed from this
 script, introducing a filter based on the original demoronizer, which in turn could
 correct these errors on the fly. 
</para>
<para>
 But this is only needed in some situations, and will cause serious problems in some 
 other situations.
</para>
<para>
 If you are using Microsoft products, you do not need it. If you need to view 
 pages with UTF-8 characters (such as Cyrillic or Chinese), then it will 
 cause corruption of the fonts, and thus <emphasis>should not be on</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
 On the other hand, if you use non-Microsoft products, and you occasionally 
 notice wierd characters on pages, you might want to try it.
</para>
<para>
 This filter was introduced with version 3.0.2 of <application>Privoxy</application>,
 and was on by default in that version. It is off in all subsequent versions 
 (unless turned on by the user).
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="windowopen">
<title>
 Why do I keep seeing <quote>PrivoxyWindowOpen()</quote> in raw source code?
</title>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> is attempting to disable malicious 
 Javascript in this case, with the <literal>unsolicited-popups</literal>
 filter. <application>Privoxy</application> cannot tell very well 
 <quote>good</quote> code snippets from <quote>bad</quote> code snippets.
</para>
<para>
 If you see this in HTML source, and the page displays without problems, then 
 this is good, and likely some pop-up window was disabled. If you see this 
 where it is causing a problem, such as a downloaded program source code file, 
 then you should set an exception for this site or page such that the
 integrity of the page stays in tact by disabling all filtering.
