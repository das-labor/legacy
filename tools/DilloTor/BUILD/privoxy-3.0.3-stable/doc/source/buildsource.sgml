<para>
 To build <application>Privoxy</application> from source, 
 <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</ulink>,
 <ulink
 url="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU make
 (gmake)</ulink>, and, of course, a C compiler like <ulink
 url="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">gcc</ulink> are required.
</para>

<para>
 When building from a source tarball (either release version or
 <ulink
 url="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/ijbswa-cvsroot.tar.bz2">nightly CVS
 tarball</ulink>), first unpack the source: 
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 tar xzvf privoxy-&p-version;<![%p-not-stable;[-beta]]>-src* [.tgz or .tar.gz]
 cd privoxy-&p-version;<![%p-not-stable;[-beta]]>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
 For retrieving the current CVS sources, you'll need CVS installed.
 Note that sources from CVS are development quality, and may not be
 stable, or well tested. To download CVS source:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co current
  cd current
</screen>
</para>

<para>
 This will create a directory named <filename>current/</filename>, which will 
 contain the source tree.
</para>

<para>
 Then, in either case, to build from unpacked tarball or CVS source:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 autoheader
 autoconf
 ./configure      # (--help to see options)
 make             # (the make from gnu, gmake for *BSD) 
 su 
 make -n install  # (to see where all the files will go)
 make install     # (to really install)
</screen>
</para>

<para>
  If you have gnu make, you can have the first four steps 
  automatically done for you by just typing:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  make
</screen>
</para>

<para>
  in the freshly downloaded or unpacked source directory.
</para>

<para>

 Windows self-extracting installers, building on platforms with
 special requirements etc, please consult the <ulink
 url="../developer-manual/newrelease.html">developer manual</ulink>.
