<para>
 At present, <application>Privoxy</application> is known to run on
 Windows(95, 98, ME, 2000, XP), Linux (RedHat, SuSE, Debian, Conectiva, Gentoo, 
 Slackware), Mac OSX, OS/2, AmigaOS, BeOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris,
 and many more flavors of Unix.

<![%p-supp-userman;[
<para>
 But any operating system that runs TCP/IP, can conceivably take advantage of
 <application>Privoxy</application> in a networked situation where
 <application>Privoxy</application> would run as a server on a LAN gateway. 
 Then only the <quote>gateway</quote> needs to be running one of the above
 operating systems.
</para>

<para>
 Source code is freely available, so porting to other operating systems 
 is always a possibility.
