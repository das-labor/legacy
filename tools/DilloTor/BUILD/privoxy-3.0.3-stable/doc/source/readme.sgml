 ========================================================================
 NOTE: Please read developer-manual/documentation.html before touching 
 anything in this, or other Privoxy documentation. You have been warned!
 Failure to abide by this rule will result in the revocation of your license 
 to live a peaceful existence!
 ========================================================================

 ===================================================================
 READ: Document Note: This file generates the README in the top level 
 source directory. It is generated as only a plain text file. The 
 current markup is not suitable for other formats. Build from 
 Makefile with 'make dok-readme'.
 ===================================================================

 READ:

 ======================================================================
 NOTE: The left margin spacing is *important* when using 'literallayout'
 WYSISWYG!!! Don't mess this up!!! Careful with linebreaks too, ie 
 the para tag forces a linebreak. Tags need to be carefully placed as a result
 to avoid extra blank lines, etc. 
 ======================================================================

 For stable releases, change 
 
  entity % p-not-stable "INCLUDE" 
 
 to 
 
  entity % p-not-stable "IGNORE" 
  
 in the DTD at the top. This will toggle various text 'off'. BOTH
 MUST be toggled in this case or you will get both text referencing 
 stable and unstable versions. You only want one or the other!

 MORE NEWS! January 2004, Privoxy 3.0.3 is released. This is the another 
 maintenance release of Privoxy which fixes more bugs, further refines
 the configuration and works around some known third-party problems. See the
 ChangeLog for complete details. Upgrading from 3.0.2 is recommended.
</para>
<para>
 NEWS! March 2003, Privoxy 3.0.2 is released. This is the first maintenance
 release of Privoxy. There are no significant new features in this release.
 Some bugs are fixed, and some existing features have been enhanced. See 
 ChangeLog for details. Upgrading from 3.0.0 is recommended.
</para>
<para>
 REALLY BIG NEWS! August 2002: The long-awaited, oft-delayed  stable version
 of Privoxy 3.0 is finally released! This is way behind schedule, but better
 late than never. The developers all hope the wait was worth it.
</para>
<para>
 NEWS! As of 03/24/02, the name of this project has been changed from
 ijbswa/Junkbuster to Privoxy. This is reflected in many of the included
 files. 
</para>
<para>
 WARNING! If upgrading from earlier versions of this project via RPM packages,
 the new package will delete any previously installed 'Junkbuster' packages.
</para>
<para>
 IMPORTANT! READ! Configuration Change as of 17 Mar 2002: The default listening
 port is now 8118 due to conflicts with port 8000 assignment. You will need to
 change your browser if upgrading!!! And maybe firewall, etc.

 If no config_file is specified on the command line, Privoxy will look for a
 file named 'config' in the current directory (except Win32 which will look
 for 'config.txt'). If no config_file is found, Privoxy will fail to start.

<sect1 id="configuration"><title>CONFIGURATION</title>
<para>
 See: 'config', 'default.action', 'user.action', and 'default.filter'.
 'user.action' is for personal and local configuration preferences. These are
 all well commented. Most of the magic is in '*.action' files. 'user.action'
 should be used for any actions customizations. On Unix-like systems, these
 files are installed in /etc/privoxy.  On Windows, then wherever the
 executable itself is installed. There are many significant changes and
 advances since Junkbuster v2.0.x. The User Manual has an explanation of
 all configuration options, and examples: http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/.
</para>
<para>
 Be sure to set your browser(s) for HTTP/HTTPS Proxy at &lt;IP&gt;:&lt;Port&gt;, or
 whatever you specify in the config file under 'listen-address'. DEFAULT is
 localhost:8118. Note that Privoxy ONLY proxies HTTP (and HTTPS) traffic. Do not try it 
 with FTP or other protocols for the simple reason it does not work.
</para>
<para>
 The actions list can be configured via the web interface accessed via
 http://p.p/, as well other options.

<sect1 id="documentation"><title>DOCUMENTATION</title>
<para>
 There should be documentation in the 'doc' subdirectory<![%p-not-stable;[, but it
 is not completed at this point]]>. In particular, see the User Manual there,
 the FAQ, and those interested in Privoxy development, should look at
 developer-manual. 
</para>

 <![%p-not-stable;[
 The most up to date source of information on the current development version,
 may still be either comments in the source code, or the included
 configuration files. ]]>The source and configuration files are all well
 commented. The main configuration files are: 'config', 'default.action', and
 'default.filter'<![%p-not-stable;[ in the toplevel source directory]]>.
