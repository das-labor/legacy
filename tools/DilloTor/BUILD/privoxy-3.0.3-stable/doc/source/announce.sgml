 ===================================================================
 NOTE: This will is designed to build a generic announcement for use 
 with new releases of Privoxy. It will build both a short and long 
 version. Also, both text and html versions are generated, so that 
 press release packages can contain both formats for those that might 
 prefer HTML ready announce text.

 This may require a small bit of hand editing before processing. 
 The intention is to minimize this as much as possible.

 To create: make announce
