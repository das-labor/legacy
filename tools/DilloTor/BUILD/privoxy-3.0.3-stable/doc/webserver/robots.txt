# This is the Privoxy web site.

# If the robot is connecting through Privoxy, then the
# control interface is at /config.   It isn't very useful
# to index it, and you're likely to break stuff.  So go away!
#
# Even if you're not connected through Privoxy, the 
# one "Privoxy is not working" page there is not very
# interesting.
