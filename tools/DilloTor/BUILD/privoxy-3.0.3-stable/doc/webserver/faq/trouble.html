What can I do?</A

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

 by toggling off <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> through <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/toggle"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/toggle</A
>,
 and then shift-reloading the problem page (i.e. holding down the shift key
 while clicking reload. Alternatively, flush your browser's disk and memory
 caches).</P
><P
> If still a problem, go to <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</A
>
 and paste the full URL of the page in question into the prompt. See which actions
 are being applied to the URL, and which matches in which actions files are
 responsible for that. Now, armed with this information, go to <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/show-status"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/show-status</A
>
 and select the appropriate actions files for editing.</P
><P
> You can now either look for a section which disables the actions that
 you suspect to cause the problem and add a pattern for your site there,
 or make up a completely new section for your site. In any case, the recommended
 way is to disable only the prime suspect, reload the problem page, and only
 if the problem persists, disable more and more actions until you have
 identified the culprit. You may or may not want to turn the other actions
 on again. Remember to flush your browser's caches in between any such changes!</P
><P
> Alternately, if you are comfortable with a text editor, you can accomplish 
 the same thing by editing the appropriate actions file. Probably the easiest 
 way to deal with such problems when editing by hand is to add your
 site to a <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>{ fragile }</VAR
> section in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>user.action</TT
>,
 which is an alias that turns off most <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dangerous"</SPAN
>
 actions, but is also likely to turn off more actions then needed, and thus lower
 your privacy and protection more than necessary, </P

NAME="DUN"
>5.4. After installing <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>, I have to log in
every time I start IE. What gives?</A
></H3
><P
> This is a quirk that effects the installation of
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>, in conjunction with Internet Explorer and
 Internet Connection Sharing on Windows 2000 and Windows XP. The symptoms may
 appear to be corrupted or invalid DUN settings, or passwords.</P
><P
> When setting up an NT based Windows system with
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> you may find that things do not seem to be
 doing what you expect. When you set your system up you will probably have set
 up Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) with Dial up Networking (DUN) when
 logged in with administrator privileges. You will probably have made this DUN
 connection available to other accounts that you may have set-up on your
 system. E.g. Mum or Dad sets up the system and makes accounts suitably
 configured for the kids.</P
><P
> When setting up <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> in this environment you
 will have to alter the proxy set-up of Internet Explorer (IE) for the
 specific DUN connection on which you wish to use
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>. When you do this the ICS DUN set-up
 becomes user specific. In this instance you will see no difference if you
 change the DUN connection under the account used to set-up the connection.
 However when you do this from another user you will notice that the DUN
 connection changes to make available to "Me only". You will also find that
 you have to store the password under each different user!</P
><P
> The reason for this is that each user's set-up for IE is user specific. Each
 set-up DUN connection and each LAN connection in IE store the settings for
 each user individually. As such this enforces individual configurations
 rather than common ones. Hence the first time you use a DUN connection after
 re-booting your system it may not perform as you expect, and prompt you for 
 the password. Just set and save the password again and all should be OK.</P

NAME="FTP"

CLASS="APPLICATION"

 seems to be blocking me.</A
></H3
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> cannot act as a proxy for FTP traffic, 
  so do not configure your browser to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
  as an FTP proxy. The same is true for <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>any protocol other than HTTP
  or HTTPS</I
></SPAN
>. 
 </P
><P
>  Most browsers understand FTP as well as HTTP. If you connect to a site, with
  a URL like <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp://ftp.example.com</VAR
>, your browser is making
  an FTP connection, and not a HTTP connection. So while your browser may 
  speak FTP, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> does not, and cannot proxy 
  such traffic.
 </P
><P
>  To complicate matters, some systems may have a generic <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"proxy"</SPAN
>
  setting, which will silently enable <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>both</I
></SPAN
> HTTP and FTP
  proxying! So it is possible to accidentally enable FTP proxying in these
  cases. And of course, if this happens, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
  will indeed cause problems since it does not know FTP.
 </P
><P
>  Will <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

  There just is not much reason, and the work to make this happen is more than
  it may seem.

  network settings.  In order to change the HTTP proxy, open System
  Preferences, and click on the Network icon.  In the settings pane that

><P
> The original demoronizer was a Perl script that cleaned up HTML pages which 
 were created with certain Microsoft products. MS has used proprietary extensions 
 to standardized font encodings (ISO 8859-1), which has caused problems for pages
 that are viewed with non-Microsoft products (and are expecting to see a
 standard set of fonts). The demoronizer corrected these errors so the pages
 displayed correctly. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> borrowed from this
 script, introducing a filter based on the original demoronizer, which in turn could
 correct these errors on the fly. </P
><P
> But this is only needed in some situations, and will cause serious problems in some 
 other situations.</P
><P
> If you are using Microsoft products, you do not need it. If you need to view 
 pages with UTF-8 characters (such as Cyrillic or Chinese), then it will 
 cause corruption of the fonts, and thus <SPAN
