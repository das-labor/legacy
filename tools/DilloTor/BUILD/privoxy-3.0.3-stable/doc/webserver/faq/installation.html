   first to minimize conflicts and confusion. You may want to 
   save your old configuration files for future reference. The configuration
   files and syntax have substantially changed, so you will need to manually
   port your old patterns. See the <A

><P
> All browsers must be told to use <SPAN

 You should also flush your browser's memory and disk cache to get rid of any
 cached junk items, and remove any stored cookies.&#13;</P

></H3
><P
>  If you set up the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> to run on
  the computer you browse from (rather than your ISP's server or some
  networked computer on a LAN), the proxy will be on <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>127.0.0.1</VAR
> 
  (sometimes referred to as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"localhost"</SPAN
>,
  which is the special name used by every computer on the Internet to refer
  to itself) and the port will be 8118 (unless you have <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
  to run on a different port with the <A
HREF="../user-manual/config.html#LISTEN-ADDRESS"
TARGET="_top"
>listen-address</A
> config option). 
 </P
><P
>  When configuring your browser's proxy settings you typically enter
  the word <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"localhost"</SPAN
> or the IP address <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"127.0.0.1"</SPAN
>
  in the boxes next to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"HTTP"</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Secure"</SPAN
> (HTTPS) and
  then the number <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"8118"</SPAN
> for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"port"</SPAN
>. 
  This tells your browser to send all web requests to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
  instead of directly to the Internet.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can also be used to proxy for 
  a Local Area Network. In this case, your would enter either the IP 
  address of the LAN host where <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> 
  is running, or the equivalent hostname. Port assignment would be 
  same as above. Note that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> doesn't
  listen on any LAN interfaces by default.
 </P

>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

  any other protocols such as FTP, SMTP, IM, IRC, ICQ, etc.

>2.7. I just installed <SPAN

All the ads are there. What's wrong?</A
></H3
><P
> Did you configure your browser to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> 
 as a proxy? It does not sound like it. See above. You might also try flushing
 the browser's caches to force a full re-reading of pages. You can verify 
 that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is running, and your browser 
 is correctly configured by entering the special URL: 
 <A
HREF="http://p.p/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://p.p/</A
>. 
 
 This should take you to a page titled <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"This is Privoxy.."</SPAN
> with
 access to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
> internal configuration.
 If you see this, then you are good to go. If you receive a page saying 
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Privoxy is not running"</SPAN
>, then the browser is not set up to use
 your <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> installation.
 If you receive anything else (probably nothing at all), it could either
 be that the browser is not set up correctly, or that
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is not running at all. Check the <A
HREF="../user-manual/config.html#LOGFILE"
TARGET="_top"
>log file</A
>. For instructions
 on starting <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> and browser configuration,

 other parts of <SPAN

 the dummy page, your browser has cached a redirection it encountered before
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 browser's cache. Note that shift-reloading the dummy page won't help, since
 that'll only refresh the dummy page, not the redirection that lead you there.</P
><P
> The procedure for clearing the cache varies from browser to browser. As an
 example, <SPAN

 <SPAN

 <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"

 then click both <SPAN
