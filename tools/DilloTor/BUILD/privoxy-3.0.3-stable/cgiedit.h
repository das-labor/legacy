 *    Moved cgi_error_disabled() from cgiedit.c to
 *    cgi.c to re-enable build with --disable-editor.
 *    Fixes Bug #892744. Thanks to Matthew Fischer
 *    for spotting.
 *
 *    Revision 1.7.2.1  2002/11/28 18:15:17  oes
 *    Added cgi_error_disabled
 *
 *    Revision 1.7  2002/03/26 22:29:54  swa
 *    we have a new homepage!
 *
 *    Revision 1.6  2002/03/24 13:25:43  swa
 *    name change related issues
 *
 *    Revision 1.5  2002/01/22 23:24:48  jongfoster
 *    Adding edit-actions-section-swap
 *
 *    Revision 1.4  2001/11/13 00:28:51  jongfoster
 *    Adding new CGIs for use by non-JavaScript browsers:
 *      edit-actions-url-form
 *      edit-actions-add-url-form
 *      edit-actions-remove-url-form
 *
 *    Revision 1.3  2001/10/23 21:48:19  jongfoster
 *    Cleaning up error handling in CGI functions - they now send back
 *    a HTML error page and should never cause a FATAL error.  (Fixes one
 *    potential source of "denial of service" attacks).
 *
 *    CGI actions file editor that works and is actually useful.
 *
 *    Ability to toggle JunkBuster remotely using a CGI call.
 *
 *    You can turn off both the above features in the main configuration
 *    file, e.g. if you are running a multi-user proxy.
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/10/14 22:12:49  jongfoster
 *    New version of CGI-based actionsfile editor.
 *    Major changes, including:
 *    - Completely new file parser and file output routines
 *    - edit-actions CGI renamed edit-actions-for-url
 *    - All CGIs now need a filename parameter, except for...
 *    - New CGI edit-actions which doesn't need a filename,
 *      to allow you to start the editor up.
 *    - edit-actions-submit now works, and now automatically
 *      redirects you back to the main edit-actions-list handler.
 *
 *    Revision 1.1  2001/09/16 15:47:37  jongfoster
 *    First version of CGI-based edit interface.  This is very much a
 *    work-in-progress, and you can't actually use it to edit anything
 *    yet.  You must #define FEATURE_CGI_EDIT_ACTIONS for these changes
 *    to have any effect.
