 *
 * Revisions   :
 *    $Log: actions.h,v $
 *    Revision 1.12  2002/05/06 07:56:50  oes
 *    Made actions_to_html independent of FEATURE_CGI_EDIT_ACTIONS
 *
 *    Revision 1.11  2002/04/30 11:14:52  oes
 *    Made csp the first parameter in *action_to_html
 *
 *    Revision 1.10  2002/04/26 12:53:33  oes
 *     -  actions_to_html signature change
 *     -  current_action_to_text: renamed to current_action_to_html
 *        and signature change
 *
 *    Revision 1.9  2002/03/26 22:29:54  swa
 *    we have a new homepage!
 *
 *    Revision 1.8  2002/03/24 13:25:43  swa
 *    name change related issues
 *
 *    Revision 1.7  2002/03/16 23:54:06  jongfoster
 *    Adding graceful termination feature, to help look for memory leaks.
 *    If you enable this (which, by design, has to be done by hand
 *    editing config.h) and then go to http://i.j.b/die, then the program
 *    will exit cleanly after the *next* request.  It should free all the
 *    memory that was used.
 *
 *    Revision 1.6  2001/10/23 21:30:30  jongfoster
 *    Adding error-checking to selected functions.
 *
 *    Revision 1.5  2001/10/14 21:58:22  jongfoster
 *    Adding support for the CGI-based editor:
 *    - Exported get_actions()
 *    - Added new function free_alias_list()
 *    - Added support for {{settings}} and {{description}} blocks
 *      in the actions file.  They are currently ignored.
 *    - Added restriction to only one {{alias}} block which must appear
 *      first in the file, to simplify the editor's rewriting rules.
 *    - Note that load_actions_file() is no longer used by the CGI-based
 *      editor, but some of the other routines in this file are.
 *
 *    Revision 1.4  2001/09/16 15:47:37  jongfoster
 *    First version of CGI-based edit interface.  This is very much a
 *    work-in-progress, and you can't actually use it to edit anything
 *    yet.  You must #define FEATURE_CGI_EDIT_ACTIONS for these changes
 *    to have any effect.
 *
 *    Revision 1.3  2001/09/14 00:17:32  jongfoster
 *    Tidying up memory allocation. New function init_action().
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/07/29 19:01:11  jongfoster
 *    Changed _FILENAME_H to FILENAME_H_INCLUDED.
 *    Added forward declarations for needed structures.
 *
 *    Revision 1.1  2001/05/31 21:16:46  jongfoster
 *    Moved functions to process the action list into this new file.
