-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build Privoxy from source, autoconf, GNU make (gmake), and, of course, a C
compiler like gcc are required.

When building from a source tarball (either release version or nightly CVS
tarball), first unpack the source:

 tar xzvf privoxy-3.0.3-src* [.tgz or .tar.gz]
 cd privoxy-3.0.3


For retrieving the current CVS sources, you'll need CVS installed. Note that
sources from CVS are development quality, and may not be stable, or well
tested. To download CVS source:

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co current
  cd current


This will create a directory named current/, which will contain the source
tree.

Then, in either case, to build from unpacked tarball or CVS source:

 autoheader
 autoconf
 ./configure      # (--help to see options)
 make             # (the make from gnu, gmake for *BSD)
 su
 make -n install  # (to see where all the files will go)
 make install     # (to really install)


If you have gnu make, you can have the first four steps automatically done for
you by just typing:

  make


in the freshly downloaded or unpacked source directory.

For more detailed instructions on how to build Redhat and SuSE RPMs, Windows
self-extracting installers, building on platforms with special requirements
etc, please consult the developer manual.

For binary RPM installation, and other platforms, see the user-manual as well.
