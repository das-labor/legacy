 *    Temp kludge to let user and default action file be edited through win32 GUI (FR 592080)
 *
 *    Revision 1.10  2002/03/26 22:57:10  jongfoster

 *
 *    Revision 1.9  2002/03/24 12:03:47  jongfoster
 *    Name change
 *
 *    Revision 1.8  2001/07/30 22:08:36  jongfoster
 *    Tidying up #defines:
 *    - All feature #defines are now of the form FEATURE_xxx
 *    - Permanently turned off WIN_GUI_EDIT
 *    - Permanently turned on WEBDAV and SPLIT_PROXY_ARGS
 *
 *    Revision 1.7  2001/07/29 18:43:08  jongfoster
 *    Changing #ifdef _FILENAME_H to FILENAME_H_INCLUDED, to conform to
 *    ANSI C rules.
 *
 *    Revision 1.6  2001/07/13 14:04:59  oes
 *    Removed all #ifdef PCRS
 *
 *    Revision 1.5  2001/06/07 23:08:12  jongfoster
 *    Forward and ACL edit options removed.
 *
 *    Revision 1.4  2001/05/31 21:37:11  jongfoster
 *    GUI changes to rename "permissions file" to "actions file".
 *
 *    Revision 1.3  2001/05/29 09:50:24  jongfoster
 *    Unified blocklist/imagelist/permissionslist.
 *    File format is still under discussion, but the internal changes
 *    are (mostly) done.
 *
 *    Also modified interceptor behaviour:
 *    - We now intercept all URLs beginning with one of the following
 *      prefixes (and *only* these prefixes):
 *        * http://i.j.b/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sf.net/config/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/
 *    - New interceptors "home page" - go to http://i.j.b/ to see it.
 *    - Internal changes so that intercepted and fast redirect pages
 *      are not replaced with an image.
 *    - Interceptors now have the option to send a binary page direct
 *      to the client. (i.e. ijb-send-banner uses this)
 *    - Implemented show-url-info interceptor.  (Which is why I needed
 *      the above interceptors changes - a typical URL is
 *      "http://i.j.b/show-url-info?url=www.somesite.com/banner.gif".
 *      The previous mechanism would not have intercepted that, and
 *      if it had been intercepted then it then it would have replaced
 *      it with an image.)
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/05/26 00:28:36  jongfoster
 *    Automatic reloading of config file.
 *    Removed obsolete SIGHUP support (Unix) and Reload menu option (Win32).
 *    Most of the global variables have been moved to a new
 *    struct configuration_spec, accessed through csp->config->globalname
 *    Most of the globals remaining are used by the Win32 GUI.
 *
 *    Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/05/15 13:59:07  oes
 *    Initial import of version 2.9.3 source tree
