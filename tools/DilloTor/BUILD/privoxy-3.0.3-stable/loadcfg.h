 * Purpose     :  Loads settings from the configuration file into
 *                global variables.  This file contains both the 
 *                routine to load the configuration and the global
 *                variables it writes to.

 *
 * Revisions   :
 *    $Log: loadcfg.h,v $
 *    Revision 1.11.2.1  2003/03/11 11:53:59  oes
 *    Cosmetic: Renamed cryptic variable
 *
 *    Revision 1.11  2002/03/26 22:29:55  swa
 *    we have a new homepage!
 *
 *    Revision 1.10  2002/03/24 13:25:43  swa
 *    name change related issues
 *
 *    Revision 1.9  2002/03/16 23:54:06  jongfoster
 *    Adding graceful termination feature, to help look for memory leaks.
 *    If you enable this (which, by design, has to be done by hand
 *    editing config.h) and then go to http://i.j.b/die, then the program
 *    will exit cleanly after the *next* request.  It should free all the
 *    memory that was used.
 *
 *    Revision 1.8  2001/12/30 14:07:32  steudten
 *    - Add signal handling (unix)
 *    - Add SIGHUP handler (unix)
 *    - Add creation of pidfile (unix)
 *    - Add action 'top' in rc file (RH)
 *    - Add entry 'SIGNALS' to manpage
 *    - Add exit message to logfile (unix)
 *
 *    Revision 1.7  2001/07/30 22:08:36  jongfoster
 *    Tidying up #defines:
 *    - All feature #defines are now of the form FEATURE_xxx
 *    - Permanently turned off WIN_GUI_EDIT
 *    - Permanently turned on WEBDAV and SPLIT_PROXY_ARGS
 *
 *    Revision 1.6  2001/07/29 18:58:15  jongfoster
 *    Removing nested #includes, adding forward declarations for needed
 *    structures, and changing the #define _FILENAME_H to FILENAME_H_INCLUDED.
 *
 *    Revision 1.5  2001/05/26 00:28:36  jongfoster
 *    Automatic reloading of config file.
 *    Removed obsolete SIGHUP support (Unix) and Reload menu option (Win32).
 *    Most of the global variables have been moved to a new
 *    struct configuration_spec, accessed through csp->config->globalname
 *    Most of the globals remaining are used by the Win32 GUI.
 *
 *    Revision 1.4  2001/05/22 18:46:04  oes
 *
 *    - Enabled filtering banners by size rather than URL
 *      by adding patterns that replace all standard banner
 *      sizes with the "Junkbuster" gif to the re_filterfile
 *
 *    - Enabled filtering WebBugs by providing a pattern
 *      which kills all 1x1 images
 *
 *    - Added support for PCRE_UNGREEDY behaviour to pcrs,
 *      which is selected by the (nonstandard and therefore
 *      capital) letter 'U' in the option string.
 *      It causes the quantifiers to be ungreedy by default.
 *      Appending a ? turns back to greedy (!).
 *
 *    - Added a new interceptor ijb-send-banner, which
 *      sends back the "Junkbuster" gif. Without imagelist or
 *      MSIE detection support, or if tinygif = 1, or the
 *      URL isn't recognized as an imageurl, a lame HTML
 *      explanation is sent instead.
 *
 *    - Added new feature, which permits blocking remote
 *      script redirects and firing back a local redirect
 *      to the browser.
 *      The feature is conditionally compiled, i.e. it
 *      can be disabled with --disable-fast-redirects,
 *      plus it must be activated by a "fast-redirects"
 *      line in the config file, has its own log level
 *      and of course wants to be displayed by show-proxy-args
 *      Note: Boy, all the #ifdefs in 1001 locations and
 *      all the fumbling with configure.in and acconfig.h
 *      were *way* more work than the feature itself :-(
 *
 *    - Because a generic redirect template was needed for
 *      this, tinygif = 3 now uses the same.
 *
 *    - Moved GIFs, and other static HTTP response templates
 *      to project.h
 *
 *    - Some minor fixes
 *
 *    - Removed some >400 CRs again (Jon, you really worked
 *      a lot! ;-)
 *
 *    Revision 1.3  2001/05/20 01:21:20  jongfoster
 *    Version 2.9.4 checkin.
 *    - Merged popupfile and cookiefile, and added control over PCRS
 *      filtering, in new "permissionsfile".
 *    - Implemented LOG_LEVEL_FATAL, so that if there is a configuration
 *      file error you now get a message box (in the Win32 GUI) rather
 *      than the program exiting with no explanation.
 *    - Made killpopup use the PCRS MIME-type checking and HTTP-header
 *      skipping.
 *    - Removed tabs from "config"
 *    - Moved duplicated url parsing code in "loaders.c" to a new funcition.
 *    - Bumped up version number.
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/05/17 23:01:01  oes
 *     - Cleaned CRLF's from the sources and related files
 *
 *    Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/05/15 13:58:58  oes
 *    Initial import of version 2.9.3 source tree
