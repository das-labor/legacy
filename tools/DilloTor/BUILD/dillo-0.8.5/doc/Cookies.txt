==================
 Cookies in Dillo
==================

 The cookie support in Dillo aims to support cookies of the old
original Netscape style, as well as the kind specified in RFC 2109.
 Between sessions, the cookies get saved to ~/.dillo/cookies.
At the moment the only enforcements on the amount of cookies to
save to disk is max 20 per domain.
 There's also a file for controlling cookies: ~/.dillo/cookiesrc. Dillo
initially sets it to ignore (reject) all cookies, so if you want to use
cookies, change it to meet your needs.

 If you don't want cookies at all, you have two options:

1.- Delete ~/.dillo/cookiesrc (or leave it just as dillo creates it).
2. Configure Dillo with ./configure --disable-cookies. Then all the
   cookie stuff will be skipped at compilation.


=====================
 Controlling cookies
=====================

 There is a small and simple way to restrict urls from setting cookies
in Dillo. In the file ~/.dillo/cookiesrc You may specify rules
for different domains. The syntax looks something like this:

DEFAULT       DENY
slashdot.org  ACCEPT
.host.com     ACCEPT_SESSION

 The first line says that we should deny all cookies from all domains
by default.
 The second one tells Dillo to save all cookies from slashdot.org
across sessions, until it expires.
 And finally, the third says that all subdomains of host.com should be
allowed to set cookies. But these cookies will only be saved in
memory until you exit.


===================
 Cookies & Privacy
===================

 Cookies can be a severe threat to personal privacy. The pages you
visit can be tracked, logged, and associated to a peronal data-record,
allowing the possibility of building a detailed profile of your
browsing habits.

 This data is sold to companies that profit from direct use of such
information (SPAM, Spying, etc).

 If this data is cross-referenced with other databases, they can end up
with more information than you have about yourself.

 Some people may tell you this is "paranoid". But please, take my words
as those of someone that has written a web browser, a cookies implementation,
and that has deep understanding of HTTP (RFC-2068) and cookies (RFC-2965).

 Non technical persons may like to read:

   http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/16455.html (about user-spying)

 The dillo project is especially concerned about privacy and security
issues. Our advice is to avoid cookies whenever possible and at most set
ACCEPT_SESSION to specific, trusted sites.  -- You have been warned.


==============
 Restrictions
==============

 If you use a single dillo with multiple windows, then there's no
problem, but if you launch different dillos the latter ones will
have cookies disabled.



Thats all folks!
