dillo-0.8.4 [Jan 11, 2005]

 - * Fixed a possible attack (program abortion) by malicious web pages, which
     contain huge values for <table> attributes "colspan" and "rowspan".
   * Changed anchors, they are now tested to be unique, and removed properly,
     when a widget tree is changed (e.g. another page is visited). Also added
     HTML warnings.
   Patches: Sebastian Geerken

   * Removed obsolete code from IO/file.c.
   * Added a few missing EINTR handlers in dpi.c.
   * Orthogonalized the generic parser:
       - Fixes memory leaks and widget state when recovering from bad HTML.
       - Improves error detection and validation (needed by XHTML).
       - Makes DOC tree generation possible (needed by CSS).
       - Cleaner design of handling routines for bad HTML.
       - Orthodox treatment of double optional elements (HTML, HEAD, BODY).
       - Lots of minor code cleanups.
   * Switched the dpi file server's design to pthreads (fixes a critical race).
   * Avoided a crash when indexed GIF images lack a color map (BUG#647).
   * Fixed a bug when the remote HTTP server sends no Content-Type and
     the TCP packetizing splits the header from data (BUG#650).
   * Returned the parser to the old whitespace "collapsing" mode
     (this can be changed with the SGML_SPCDEL define in html.c).
   * Fixed a memory leak for DwStyle (there was one leak per page).
   Patches: Jorge Arellano
 - * Fixed a large memory leak of thread specific resources. --Very important
   Patch: Jorge Arellano, Livio Baldini

     the FORM repost dialog.
   * Designed and implemented a unified API for handling data streams inside
