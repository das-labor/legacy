Todo List

 File dpi_service.c
 This module should be removed because its original functions
 have been removed or modified. Put these functions in dpid.c

 File dpi_service.h
 This module should be removed because its original functions
 have been removed or modified. Put these functions in dpid.c

 Global get_dpi_attr(char *dpi_dir, char *service, struct dp *dpi_attr)
 Add other file types, but first we need to add files associated
 with a dpi to the design.

 Global SRS_NAME
 Should read this from dillorc

 File dpid_common.h
 The dpid error codes will be used in the next patch

 Global main()
 + add new plugins when they become available
 __________________________________________________________

Remove global variables.

Use a singly linked list for dpi_attr_list

Allow dpis to be registered one at a time

Only run dpis listed in users dillorc

MAYBE Have dpid accept all connections to dpis (fixes inf loop if dpi crashes before accept)
