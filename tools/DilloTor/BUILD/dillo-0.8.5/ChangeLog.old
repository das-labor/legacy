===========================================================================
Raph Levien project


Mon Dec 21 00:07:36 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

  * gzilladns.c: fixed a bug (adding the input handler more
  than once) that got triggered in Gtk 1.1.x.
  * gzillageturl.c: added an "about:" mechanism with simple
  redirects. This is 0.1.7.

Sun Dec 20 22:25:17 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

  * Accelerator group code so that it now compiles with both
  Gtk 1.0.x and 1.1.x
  * Added directory scanning support to gzilla_file (thanks to Jim
  McBeath!)

0.1.5 (2 Jan 1998 RLL)
  * Finished moving junk out of bytesink (mostly into linkblock).
  Now, the former abstraction is lean and mean, and the latter
  is a junkheap :).
  * Tried to hook up most of the abort/destroy logic, so it should
  leak a lot less memory now.
  * I'm moving images from gtk_preview to gzw_image as well.

0.1.4 (26 Nov 1997 RLL)
  * Pages > 32kpixels actually scroll now.
  * Pretty significant rework of the whole abort architecture (see
  abort.html for more details). Also separated out some of the
  web-specific stuff in bytesink to linkblock.
  * It seems relatively stable now, but it's nowhere near freeing
  all of the memory it allocates.

0.1.3
  * Switched page widget from gtk to gzw.
  * Significant enhancements in functionality and stability.
        
0.0.10
  * Major change is reorganization of network code - all fetches now
  go through gzilla_url_get.

  * Aborts (i.e. the implementation of the Stop button) are now
  handled by a new bytesink signal ("abort"). The abort logic has
  been partially upgraded to handle multiple windows - now,
  gzilla_bw_abort_all aborts all bytesinks in a window.
