.SH NAME
privoxy \- Privacy Enhancing Proxy
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBprivoxy\fR [\fB--help\fR ] [\fB--version\fR ] [\fB--no-daemon\fR ] [\fB--pidfile \fIpidfile\fB\fR ] [\fB--user \fIuser[.group]\fB\fR ] [\fB--chroot\fR ] [\fB\fIconfigfile\fB\fR ]\fB (UNIX)\fR


\fBprivoxy.exe\fR [\fB\fIconfigfile\fB\fR ]\fB (Windows)\fR

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR may be invoked with the following command line
options:
.TP
\fB--help\fR
Print brief usage info and exit.
.TP
\fB--version\fR
Print version info and exit.
.TP
\fB--no-daemon\fR
Don't  become  a daemon, i.e. don't fork and become process group
leader, don't detach from controlling tty, and do all logging there.
.TP
\fB--pidfile \fIpidfile\fB\fR
On startup, write the process ID to \fIpidfile\fR.
Delete the \fIpidfile\fR on exit.
Failure to create or delete the \fIpidfile\fR
is non-fatal. If no \fB--pidfile\fR option is given, no PID file will be used.
.TP
\fB--user \fIuser[.group]\fB\fR
After (optionally) writing the PID file, assume the user ID of
\fIuser\fR and the GID of
\fIgroup\fR, or, if the optional
\fIgroup\fR was not given, the default group of
\fIuser\fR. Exit if the privileges are not
sufficient to do so.
.TP
\fB--chroot\fR
Before changing to the user ID given in the --user option, chroot to
that user's home directory, i.e. make the kernel pretend to the
\fBPrivoxy\fR process that the directory tree starts
there. If set up carefully, this can limit the impact of possible
vulnerabilities in \fBPrivoxy\fR to the files contained in
that hierarchy. 
.PP
If the \fIconfigfile\fR is not specified on  the  command  line,
\fBPrivoxy\fR  will  look for a file named
\fIconfig\fR in the current directory (except on Win32 where
it will try \fIconfig.txt\fR). If no
\fIconfigfile\fR is found, \fBPrivoxy\fR will 
fail to start.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR is a web proxy with advanced filtering
capabilities for protecting privacy, modifying web page content, managing
cookies, controlling access, and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other
obnoxious Internet junk. \fBPrivoxy\fR has a very
flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and
tastes. \fBPrivoxy\fR has application for both
stand-alone systems and multi-user networks.
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR is based on \fBInternet
Junkbuster\fR (tm).
.SH "INSTALLATION AND USAGE"
.PP
Browsers must be individually configured to use \fBPrivoxy\fR as
a HTTP proxy.  The default setting is  for  localhost,  on port  8118
(configurable in the main config file).  To set the HTTP proxy in Netscape
and Mozilla, go through:  \fBEdit\fR;
\fBPreferences\fR;  \fBAdvanced\fR;
\fBProxies\fR;  \fBManual Proxy Configuration\fR;
\fBView\fR. 
.PP
For Internet Explorer, go through: \fBTools\fR; 
\fBInternet Properties\fR; \fBConnections\fR;
\fBLAN Settings\fR. 
.PP
The Secure (SSL) Proxy should also be set to the same values, otherwise
https: URLs will not be proxied. Note: \fBPrivoxy\fR can only
proxy HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Do not try it with FTP or other protocols.
.PP
For other browsers, check the documentation.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR can be configured with the various configuration
files. The default configuration files are: \fIconfig\fR,
\fIdefault.filter\fR, and
\fIdefault.action\fR. \fIuser.action\fR should 
be used for locally defined exceptions to the default rules of
\fIdefault.action\fR These are all well commented.  On Unix
and Unix-like systems, these are located in
\fI/etc/privoxy/\fR by default. On Windows, OS/2 and AmigaOS,
these files are in the same directory as the \fBPrivoxy\fR
executable.
.PP
The name and number of configuration files has changed from previous
versions. In fact, the configuration itself is changed  and  much more
sophisticated. See the user-manual for a complete
explanation of all configuration options and general usage, and notes for 
upgrading from \fBJunkbuster\fR and earlier \fBPrivoxy\fR
versions.
.PP
The actions list (ad blocks, etc) can also be configured with your
web browser at http://config.privoxy.org/.
\fBPrivoxy's\fR configuration parameters  can also  be viewed at
the same page. In addition, \fBPrivoxy\fR can be toggled on/off.
This is an internal page, and does not require Internet access.
.SH "SAMPLE CONFIGURATION"
.PP
A brief example of what a simple \fIdefault.action\fR
configuration might look like:

.nf
 # Define a few useful custom aliases for later use
 {{alias}}

 # Useful aliases
 +crunch-cookies = +crunch-incoming-cookies +crunch-outgoing-cookies
 -crunch-cookies = -crunch-incoming-cookies -crunch-outgoing-cookies
 +imageblock      = +block +handle-as-image

 # Fragile sites should have the minimum changes
 fragile     = -block -deanimate-gifs -fast-redirects -filter \\
               -hide-referer -prevent-cookies -kill-popups

 ## Turn some actions on ################################
 { \\
 -add-header \\
 -block \\
 +deanimate-gifs{last} \\
 -downgrade-http-version \\
 -fast-redirects \\
 +filter{html-annoyances} \\
 +filter{js-annoyances} \\
 +filter{content-cookies} \\
 +filter{webbugs} \\
 +filter{banners-by-size} \\
 +hide-forwarded-for-headers \\
 +hide-from-header{block} \\
 +hide-referrer{forge} \\
 -hide-user-agent \\
 -handle-as-image \\
 +set-image-blocker{pattern} \\
 -limit-connect \\
 +prevent-compression \\
 +session-cookies-only \\
 -crunch-cookies \\
 -kill-popups \\
 }
 /   # '/' Matches *all* URL patterns
 
 # Block, and treat these URL patterns as if they were 'images'.
 # We would expect these to be ads.
 {+imageblock}
  .ad.doubleclick.net
  .a[0-9].yimg.com/(?:(?!/i/).)*$
  ad.*.doubleclick.net

 # Block any URLs that match these patterns
 {+block}
  ad*.
  .*ads.
  banner?.
  /.*count(er)?\\.(pl|cgi|exe|dll|asp|php[34]?)
  .hitbox.com 

 # Make exceptions for these harmless ones that would be 
 # caught by our +block patterns just above.
 {-block}
  adsl.
  advice.
  .*downloads.
.fi
.PP
Then for a \fIuser.action\fR, we would put local,
narrowly defined exceptions:

.nf
 # Re-define aliases as needed here
 {{alias}}

 # Useful aliases
 -crunch-cookies = -crunch-incoming-cookies -crunch-outgoing-cookies
 
 # Set personal exceptions to the policies in default.action #######

 # Sites where we want persistant cookies, so allow *all* cookies
 {-crunch-cookies -session-cookies-only}
  .redhat.com
  .sun.com
  .msdn.microsoft.com
 
 # This site breaks easily.
 {-block -fast-redirects}
  .forbes.com
.fi
.PP
See the comments in the configuration files themselves, or the 
\fIuser-manual\fR
for explanations of the above syntax, and other \fBPrivoxy\fR
configuration options.
.SH "FILES"

.nf
 
 \fI/usr/sbin/privoxy\fR
 \fI/etc/privoxy/config\fR
 \fI/etc/privoxy/default.action\fR
 \fI/etc/privoxy/standard.action\fR
 \fI/etc/privoxy/user.action\fR
 \fI/etc/privoxy/default.filter\fR
 \fI/etc/privoxy/trust\fR
 \fI/etc/privoxy/templates/*\fR
 \fI/var/log/privoxy/logfile\fR
.fi
.PP
Various other files should be included, but may vary depending on platform
and build configuration. More documentation should be included in the local
documentation directory.
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR terminates on the \fBSIGINT\fR,
\fBSIGTERM\fR and \fBSIGABRT\fR signals. Log
rotation scripts may cause a re-opening of the logfile by sending a 
\fBSIGHUP\fR to \fBPrivoxy\fR. Note that unlike
other daemons,  \fBPrivoxy\fR does not need to be made aware of
config file changes by \fBSIGHUP\fR -- it will detect them
automatically. 
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Please see the \fIUser Manual\fR on how to contact the
developers for feature requests, reporting problems, and other questions.
