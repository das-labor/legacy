     development is potentially open to anyone who has the time, knowledge,
     and desire to contribute in any capacity. Our goals are simply to
     continue the mission, to improve <SPAN

     to make it available to as wide an audience as possible.

    You can submit your ideas, or even better patches. Patches are best 
    submitted to the Sourceforge tracker set up for this purpose, but 
    can be sent to the list for review too.

>     You will also need to have a cvs package installed, which will 
     entail having ssh installed as well (which seems to be a requirement of
     SourceForge), in order to access the cvs repository. Having the GNU build
     tools is also going to be important (particularly, autoconf and gmake).
    </P

>      For the time being (read, this section is under construction), you can 
      also refer to the extensive comments in the source code. In fact, 
      reading the code is recommended in any case.
