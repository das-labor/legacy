ChangeLog for Privoxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Since 3.0.2 (to become Version 3.0.3 soon) ***

- Fixed yet another two memory leaks. Process growth seems stopped now.
- Further tightened security against malicious toggle-off links.
- Excluded text/plain MIME types from filtering. This fixes a
  couple of client-crashing, download corruption and
  Privoxy performance issues, whose root cause lies in
  web servers labelling content of unknown type as text/plain.
- Assorted fixes for POSIX compliance, signal handling, graceful
  termination, compiler warnings, OSX support, Win32 systray,
  error logging, hostname wildcards, correct detection of NetBSD.
- Workarounds for client (iTunes etc) and server (PHP < 4.2.3) bugs
  including the notorious "blank page" problem.
- Various filter improvements; most notably the unsolicited-popups
  filter became less destructive     
- Major revamp of the actions file
	
*** Version 3.0.2 ***

- Fixed two memory leaks, one serious
- Fixed bug in pcrs which could cause crashes with user-defined filters

- Added basic support for the OPTIONS and TRACE http methods
- Added workaround for Bug in Mac OSX that made Privoxy crash occasionally
- Refined the default action file through >400 items of user feedback
- Filter changes:
  - Assorted refinements, optimizations and fixes in the js-annoyances,
    img-reorder, banners-by-size, banners-by-link, webbugs, refresh-tags,
    html-annoyances, content-cookies and fun filters
  - Replaced filter "popups" by choice between two modes:
    - "unsolicited-popups" tries to catch only the unsolicited ones
    - "all-popups" tries to kill them all (as before)
  - New filter "tiny-textforms" Help those tiny or hard-wrap textareas. 
  - New filter "jumping-windows" that prevents windows from resizing
    and moving themselves

    (common cases anyway).

    all filters for exploits shall be collected
- Improved cookie logging
- Rewrote make install target. Added uninstall and install-strip
  targets.

  problem involving remote toggling and action file manipulation
  by mailicious websites.

  reflected throughout (file locations, etc).
- ijb.action is now default.action. re_filterfile is now 
  default.filter.
- http://i.j.b/ is now http://p.p/
- The 'logo' option for replacing ad iamges is removed now. 'Pattern' 
  (checkerboard) is now the default.
- RPM spec file make over.


*** Version 2.9.12 Beta *** 

- **READ**: The default listening PORT is NOW 8118!!! Changed from 
  8000 due to conflict with NAS (Network Audio Server, whatever that 
  is.)
- More CGI actions editor fixes and improvements.
- Win32 command line fix ups.
- re_filterfile now has modular sections that can be activated on a 
  per site basis. Some new goodies there too.
- +filter now takes arguments to match FILTER sections in re_filterfile
  for even more flexibility. 
- Added a new image blocker option: +image-blocker{pattern}, which 
  displays a checkerboard patthern and scales better than the logo.
- PNG images will be used in place of GIF for JB built-in images
  if configured with --enable-no-gif.
- Clean up compiler warnings (mostly).
- Improved handling of failed DNS lookups & diagnostics for failed bind
  to listen socket

- Fixes for actions cgi editor, make sure we have right file.

- Fix threading bug re: gethostbyname() that caused random 
URLs to fail in some cases.

- Web-based toggle IJB on/off support.
- Cookie handling has changed - the new +no-cookies-keep feature is now the
default.

- Start a ChangeLog :)



*** Version 2.9.3 pre-Alpha Changes ***

- Amiga support (completely untested by me - I don't have an Amiga)
- "tinygif 3" support (redirects blocked images to a specified URL, so
the browser doesn't have to load and cache many copies of the same
image).
- one case where there were both local and global "referrer" variables
(yuck!) clarified by renaming the local one to "refer".
- Fixed some places where close() was used instead of close_socket().
Thanks to Jörg Strohmayer (joergs at users.sourceforge.net) for these.
- Temporary hack to get FORCE_LOAD to work with IE.  I just lowercased the
FORCE_LOAD_PREFIX.  Needs fixing properly.
- Most URLs hardcoded into Junkbuster were changed to go through a script
e.g. http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/redirect.php?v=2.9.3&to=faq
The only other URLs left are the GNU GPL:
  http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html
and the home page:
  http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/
... and various URLs which will be intercepted by Junkbuster anyway.
TODO: Still need to do something with the URLs in Junkbuster Corp's 
copyright/trademark notice on the bottom of the show-proxy-args page.
- PCRE or GNU Regex is now a #define option.


*** Version 2.9.2 pre-Alpha Changes ***

- Andreas applied the latest version of the FORCE patch.


*** Version 2.9.1 pre-Alpha Changes ***

- in parsers.c, fixed two #ifdef FORCE to #ifdef FORCE_LOAD
(BTW: I think FORCE is precise enough, since loading remote
data is the whole purpose of a proxy..)
- Set the FORCE_PREFIX (back) to 'IJB-FORCE-LOAD-'. While 'noijb.'
is more elegant and looks like a hostname in the URL, it doesn't
make clear to the inexperienced user that the proxy is bypassed. It
also has a higher name collision risk.
- Filled in the function header templates for my functions in
parsers.c (again). They obviously got lost in our current
patch war ;-)
- Cut the credit for the §-referrer-option from the config file,
that Stefan had placed there.
- Improved the re_filterfile 


*** Version 2.9.0 pre-Alpha Changes ***

-  Now use PCRE, not GNU REGEX.  I have not yet had chance to check the
syntax of the block/image/cookie file to ensure that they match what
is expected - however they seem to work.
-  Replaced "configure" script with one generated by "autoconf".  Also 
use a header "config.h" (was ijbconfig.h in my previous release) for 
the #defines.  "config.h" is now generated with "autoheader" from 
"acconfig.h" and "configure.in".  (Note that to install you do not
need autoconf or autoheader - just run "./configure".)
To see command-line options, run "./configure --help".
This is my first ever autoconf script, so it has some rough edges
(how PCRE is handled is the roughest).
-  Error logging code replaced with new module errlog.c, based on the
one from JunkbusterMT (but with the threading code removed).
-  Most of Rodney's 0.21 and 0.21A patches applied. (Marked *).  I did not
apply all of these, since I had already independently done conditional
popup file, conditional image file, and integration of popup code.
- ACL, Jar and trust files conditionally compiled.
- New source file headers.
- Various cosmetic changes.  (But I have not consistently ordered the 
config files - I think that's worthwhile, but it's 1am and I want to
get this released!)
- RCS tags on .h files.
-  RCS tags are const char[] rather than const char *.  (Saves 4 bytes
per tag ;-)
- VC++ project files renamed to vc_junkbuster.*.
- show-proxy-args now shows status of all conditionals, not just REGEX
- Various functions moved around.  Most notably all the system-specific
sockets code which was spread between jcc.c, bind.c, and connect.c,
has been moved to "jbsockets.c".  The non-system-specific code from
connect.c and socks4.c has been movet to "gateway.c".  Also, the
config file loader and the global variables it writes to have been
moved to "loadcfg.c".  (Maybe this should go into loaders.c?)
And candidate for the "worst filename ever" award is "miscutil.c",
which contains, well, miscellaneous utility functions like zalloc.
(Suggestions for a better name for this file are welcome!)
- Loaders now use a common function to read a line and skip comments,
and this function also stores the proxy_args.
- Added ./junkbuster --help     (Not for Win32 GUI)
- Added ./junkbuster --version  (Not for Win32 GUI)
- Win32 resources are now all marked as "U.S. English", rather than
being a mix of "U.S. English", "U.K. English" and "Irish English".
- Version number changes to 2.9.0
