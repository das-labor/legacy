'tor' is an implementation of The Onion Routing system, as
described in a bit more detail at http://www.onion-router.net/. You
can read list archives, and subscribe to the mailing list, at
http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/.

Is your question in the FAQ? Should it be?

See the INSTALL file for a quickstart. That is all you will probably need.

You only need to look beyond this point if the quickstart in the INSTALL
doesn't work for you.

Do you want to run a tor server?

Do you want to run a hidden service?

Configuring tsocks:

  If you want to use Tor for protocols that can't use Privoxy, or
  with applications that are not socksified, then download tsocks
  (tsocks.sourceforge.net) and configure it to talk to localhost:9050
  as a socks4 server. My /etc/tsocks.conf simply has:
    server_port = 9050
    server = 127.0.0.1
  (I had to "cd /usr/lib; ln -s /lib/libtsocks.so" to get the tsocks
   library working after install, since my libpath didn't include /lib.)
  Then you can do "tsocks ssh arma@moria.mit.edu". But note that if
  ssh is suid root, you either need to do this as root, or cp a local
  version of ssh that isn't suid.

  (On Windows, you may want to look at the Hummingbird SOCKS client,
  or at SocksCap, instead.)
