## Version song and dance

%description
Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.

This package provides the "tor" program, which serves as both a client and
a relay node. Scripts will automatically create a "%{toruser}" user and
a "%{torgroup}" group, and set tor up to run as a daemon when the system
is rebooted.

Applications connect to the local Tor proxy using the SOCKS
protocol. The local proxy chooses a path through a set of relays, in
which each relay knows its predecessor and successor, but no
others. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric
key at each relay, which reveals the downstream relay.

Warnings: Tor does no protocol cleaning.  That means there is a danger
that application protocols and associated programs can be induced to
reveal information about the initiator. Tor depends on Privoxy and
similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. This is alpha code,
and is even more likely than released code to have anonymity-spoiling
bugs. The present network is very small -- this further reduces the
strength of the anonymity provided. Tor is not presently suitable
for high-stakes anonymity.

%changelog

* Mon Jan 17 2005 John Bashinski <jbash@velvet.com>
- Take runtime user and group names from configure system. Default
  user/group names are now "_tor"; blame Roger...
- Make logrotate control file a separate file in the source distribution,
  rather than creating it from the spec file.
- Properly handle the order in which RPM executes scriptlets on upgrade.
  The old code would kill the daemon on upgrade.
- Start the tor daemon after installation if and only if it was
  running before installation. Preserve runlevel setup on upgrade.
- Package the torctl script; the init script is now a wrapper around it.

* Tue Nov  5 2004 John Bashinski <jbash@velvet.com>
- Add skeletal support for multiple distributions
- Even more ridiculous level of macro-ization
- Modify version numbers so RPM can determine when it has a newer version
- Return to including distribution name in package release number
- Sharply trim description
- Change user/group name from "tor" to "tordmn"; "tor" is a common
  given name (reported by Marius Hjelle)
- Change group to "System Environment/Daemons" (suggested by Marius Hjelle)
- Create logrotate file (suggested by Marius Hjelle)
- Make Tor run as a user proxy by default (suggested by Marius Hjelle)
- Autogenerate spec file from GNU autotools data, substituting version
  and whatnot
- Be perhaps excessively paranoid with config file and directory modes
- Remove auto-start and auto-stop at installation time; there's some kind
  of weird race going on, and it's arguably a bad thing anyway.

* Mon Jun 06 2004 Nick Mathewson <nickm@freehaven.net> 0.0.7-0.std.0.1.rc2
- Make spec file more happy with fc2 packaging

* Sat Jan 17 2004 John Bashinski <jbash@velvet.com>
- Basic spec file; tested with Red Hat 9.
