<h1>Running the <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a> client on Linux/BSD/Unix</h1>

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#installing">Step One: Download and Install Tor</a></h2>
<br />

<p>
The latest release of Tor can be found on the <a
href="/download.html">download</a> page. We have packages for Debian,
Red Hat, Gentoo, *BSD, etc there too.
</p>

<p>If you're building from source, first install <a
href="http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/">libevent</a>, and
make sure you have openssl and zlib (including the -devel packages if
applicable). Then Run <tt>tar xzf tor-0.1.0.15.tar.gz;
cd tor-0.1.0.15</tt>. Then <tt>./configure &amp;&amp; make</tt>. Now you
can run tor as <tt>src/or/tor</tt>, or you can run <tt>make install</tt>
(as root if necessary) to install it into /usr/local/, and then you can
start it just by running <tt>tor</tt>.
</p>

<p>Tor comes configured as a client by default. It uses a built-in
default configuration file, and most people won't need to change any of
the settings. Tor is now installed.
</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#privoxy">Step Two: Install Privoxy for Web Browsing</a></h2>
<br />

<p>After installing Tor, you need to configure your applications to use it.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to set up web browsing. Start by installing <a
href="http://www.privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a>: click on 'recent releases'
and pick your favorite package or install from source. Privoxy is a
filtering web proxy that integrates well with Tor.
</p>

<p>You need to configure Privoxy to use Tor.
Open Privoxy's "config" file (look in /etc/privoxy/ or /usr/local/etc/)
and add the line <br>
<tt>forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .</tt><br>
to the top of the config file. Don't forget to add the dot at the end.
</p>

<p>Privoxy keeps a log file of everything passed through it.  In
order to stop this you will need to comment out two lines by inserting a
# before the line. The two lines are:<br>
<tt>logfile logfile</tt><br>
and the line <br>
<tt>jarfile jarfile</tt><br>
</p>

<p>You'll need to restart Privoxy for the changes to take effect.</p>

<a id="using"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#using">Step Three: Configure your applications to use Tor</a></h2>
<br />

<p>After installing Tor and Privoxy, you need to configure your
applications to use them. The first step is to set up web browsing.</p>

<p>If you're using Firefox (we recommend it), check out our <a
href="tor-switchproxy.html">Tor SwitchProxy howto</a> to set up
a plugin that makes it easy to switch between using Tor and using a
direct connection.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you need to manually configure your browser to HTTP proxy
at localhost port 8118.
(That's where Privoxy listens.)
In Mozilla, this is in Edit|Preferences|Advanced|Proxies.
In Opera 7.5x it's Tools|Preferences|Network|Proxy servers.
You should click the "use the same proxy server for all protocols"
button; but see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FtpProxy">this
note</a> about Tor and ftp proxies.

<p>Using privoxy is <strong>necessary</strong> because <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">browsers
leak your DNS requests when they use a SOCKS proxy directly</a>, which
is bad for your anonymity. Privoxy also removes certain dangerous
headers from your web requests, and blocks obnoxious ad sites like
Doubleclick.</p>

<p>To Torify other applications that support HTTP proxies, just
point them at Privoxy (that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS
directly (for instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), you can point
your application directly at Tor (localhost port 9050), but see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">this
FAQ entry</a> for why this may be dangerous. For applications
that support neither SOCKS nor HTTP, take a look at <a
href="http://tsocks.sourceforge.net/">tsocks</a> or <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO#socat">socat</a>.
</p>

<p>For information on how to Torify other applications, check out the
<a href="http://wiki.noreply.org/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO">Torify
HOWTO</a>.

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#verify">Step Four: Make sure it's working</a></h2>
<br />

<p>
<a href="http://ipid.shat.net">ipid.shat.net</a> and
<a href="http://www.showmyip.com/">showmyip.com</a>
are sites that show what IP address and country you appear to be coming
from.
</p>

<p>If you don't know your current public IP address, this may not be a
very useful test. To learn your IP address, run "<tt>ifconfig</tt>".
If you are behind a NAT or firewall, though, you won't be able
to learn your public IP address. In this case, you should 1) configure
your browser to connect directly (that is, stop using Privoxy), 2) check
your IP address with one of the sites above, 3) point your browser back
to Privoxy, and 4) see whether your IP address has changed.
</p>

<p>If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's
ability to connect to itself (this includes something like SELinux on
Fedora Core 4), be sure to allow connections from
your local applications to Privoxy (local port 8118) and Tor (local port
9050). If
your firewall blocks outgoing connections, punch a hole so
it can connect to at least TCP ports 80 and 443, and then see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FirewalledClient">this
FAQ entry</a>.  If your SELinux config is not allowing tor or privoxy to
run correctly, create a file named booleans.local in the directory
/etc/selinux/targeted.  Edit this file in your favorite text editor and
insert "allow_ypbind=1".  Restart your machine for this change to take
effect.
</p>

<p>If it's still not working, look at <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ItDoesntWork">this
FAQ entry</a> for hints.</p>

<a id="server"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#server">Step Five: Configure it as a server</a></h2>
<br />

<p>The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more
people who run servers, the faster the Tor network will be. If you have
at least 20 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor by configuring your
Tor to be a server too. We have many features that make Tor servers easy
and convenient, including rate limiting for bandwidth, exit policies so
you can limit your exposure to abuse complaints, and support for dynamic
IP addresses.</p>

<p>Having servers in many different places on the Internet is what
makes Tor users secure. You may also get stronger anonymity yourself,
since remote sites can't know whether connections originated at your
computer or were relayed from others.</p>

guide.</p>
