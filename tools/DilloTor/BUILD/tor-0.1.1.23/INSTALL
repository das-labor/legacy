Most users should simply follow the directions at
http://tor.eff.org/docs/tor-doc-unix

If you got the source from cvs, run "./autogen.sh", which will run the
various auto* programs and then run ./configure for you. From there,
refer to the above instructions.

If it doesn't build for you:

  If you have problems finding libraries, try
    CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" \
    ./configure
  or
    ./configure --with-libevent-dir=/usr/local
  rather than simply ./configure.

  If you have mysterious autoconf failures while linking openssl,
  consider setting your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the openssl lib directory.
  For example, "setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/athena/lib".
