<h2><a class="anchor" href="#installing">Step One: Download and Install Tor</a></h2>
<br>
<p>
The install for MS Windows bundles <a href="../index.html.en">Tor</a>,
<a href="http://www.vidalia-project.net/">Vidalia</a> (a GUI for Tor), and <a
href="http://www.privoxy.org">Privoxy</a> (a filtering web proxy) into
one package, with the three applications pre-configured to work together.
<a href="../download.html.en">Download <!--either the stable or-->
the experimental version from the download page</a>.
</p>
<p>If the bundles don't work for you, you can download Tor by itself
from the <a href="../download.html.en">download page</a>, and then <a
href="../docs/tor-doc-unix.html.en#privoxy">install
and configure Privoxy on your own</a>.
</p>
<img alt="tor installer splash page"
src="../img/screenshot-win32-installer-splash.png" width="503" height="386">
<p>If you have previously installed Tor, Vidalia, or Privoxy
you can deselect whichever components you do not need to install
in the dialog shown below.
</p>
<img alt="select components to install"
src="../img/screenshot-win32-installer-components.png" width="503" height="386">
<p>After you have completed the installer, the components
you selected will automatically be started for you.
</p>
<!--
<p>Tor comes configured as a client by default. It uses a built-in
default configuration file, and most people won't need to change any of
the settings. Tor is now installed.
</p>
-->
<hr>
<a id="using"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#using">Step Two: Configure your applications to use Tor</a></h2>
<br>
<p>After installing Tor and Privoxy, you need to configure your
applications to use them. The first step is to set up web browsing.</p>
<p>If you're using Firefox (we recommend it), check out the <a
href="http://freehaven.net/~squires/torbutton/">Torbutton
plugin</a> that sets everything up for you. If you plan to run Firefox
on a different computer than Tor, read our <a
href="../docs/tor-switchproxy.html.en">Tor SwitchProxy howto</a> to set up
a plugin that makes it easy to switch between using Tor and using a
direct connection.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you need to manually configure your browser's proxy
settings.
In Mozilla and Firefox, this is in Edit|Preferences|Advanced|Proxies.
In Opera 7.5x it's Tools|Preferences|Network|Proxy servers.
In IE, it's Tools|Internet Options|Connections|LAN Settings|Check Proxy Server|Advanced.</p>
<img alt="Proxy settings in Firefox"
src="../img/screenshot-win32-firefox-proxies.jpg" width="525" height="505">
<p>
You should fill in "localhost"
and "8118" to point the top four protocols to Privoxy, as shown here. (Even
though Privoxy doesn't support FTP and Gopher, <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FtpProxy">you
should set them up anyway</a>.) You should also fill out the socks proxy entry to point directly to Tor ("localhost", "9050", and socks5)
to cover protocols besides the first four. Then click "OK".</p>
<p>Using Privoxy is <strong>necessary</strong> because <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">browsers
leak your DNS requests when they use a SOCKS proxy directly</a>, which
is bad for your anonymity. Privoxy also removes certain dangerous
headers from your web requests, and blocks obnoxious ad sites like
Doubleclick.</p>
<p>To Torify other applications that support HTTP proxies, just
point them at Privoxy (that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS
directly (for instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), you can point
your application directly at Tor (localhost port 9050), but see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">this
FAQ entry</a> for why this may be dangerous. For applications
that support neither SOCKS nor HTTP, take a look at <a
href="http://www.socks.permeo.com/Download/SocksCapDownload/index.asp">SocksCap</a> or
<a href="http://www.freecap.ru/eng/">FreeCap</a>.
(FreeCap is free software; SocksCap is proprietary.)</p>
<p>For information on how to Torify other applications, check out the
<a href="http://wiki.noreply.org/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO">Torify
HOWTO</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<a id="verify"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#verify">Step Three: Make sure it's working</a></h2>
<br>
<p>
Check to see that Privoxy and Vidalia are running. Privoxy's icon is
a blue or green circle with a "P" in it, and Vidalia uses a small
green onion to indicate Tor is running or a dark onion with a red "X"
when Tor is not running. You can start or stop Tor by right-clicking
on Vidalia's icon in your system tray and selecting "Start" or "Stop"
from the menu as shown below:
</p>
<img alt="Vidalia Tray Icon"
src="../img/screenshot-win32-vidalia.png" width="161" height="215">
<p>
Next, you should try using your browser with Tor and make
sure that your IP address is being anonymized. Click on the <a
href="http://serifos.eecs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/ipaddr.pl?tor=1">Tor
detector</a> and see whether it thinks you're using Tor or not.
(If that site is down, see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#IsMyConnectionPrivate">this
FAQ entry</a> for more suggestions on how to test your Tor.)
</p>
<p>If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's
ability to connect to itself, be sure to allow connections from
your local applications to local port 8118 and port 9050. If
your firewall blocks outgoing connections, punch a hole so
it can connect to at least TCP ports 80 and 443, and then see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FirewalledClient">this
FAQ entry</a>.
</p>
<p>If it's still not working, look at <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ItDoesntWork">this
FAQ entry</a> for hints.</p>

<a id="server"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#server">Step Four: Configure it as a server</a></h2>
<br>
<p>The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more
people who run servers, the faster the Tor network will be. If you have
at least 20 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor by configuring your
Tor to be a server too. We have many features that make Tor servers easy
and convenient, including rate limiting for bandwidth, exit policies so
you can limit your exposure to abuse complaints, and support for dynamic
IP addresses.</p>
<p>Having servers in many different places on the Internet is what
makes Tor users secure. <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ServerAnonymity">You
may also get stronger anonymity yourself</a>,
since remote sites can't know whether connections originated at your
computer or were relayed from others.</p>
