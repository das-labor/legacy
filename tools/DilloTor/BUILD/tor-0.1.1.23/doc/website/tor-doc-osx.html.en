<h1>Running the <a href="../index.html.en">Tor</a> client on Mac OS X</h1>

<b>Note that these are the installation instructions for running a Tor client on

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#installing">Step One: Download and Install Tor</a></h2>
<br>
<p>
The latest stable and experimental releases of Tor for Macintosh
OS X bundle <a href="../index.html.en">Tor</a>,
<a href="http://www.vidalia-project.net/">Vidalia</a> (a GUI for Tor),
and <a href="http://www.privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a> (a filtering web proxy)
into one package, pre-configured to work together.
<a href="../download.html.en">Download one from the download
page</a>.
</p>
<p>Our Tor installer should make everything pretty simple. Below is a
screenshot of the setup page:
</p>
<img alt="tor installer splash page"
src="../img/screenshot-osx-installer-splash.png"
border="1" width="620" height="440">
<p>When the installer is finished, you can start Vidalia by selecting its icon
from your Applications folder. A dark onion with a red X in your dock means
Tor is not currently running. You can start Tor by selecting Start from the
"Tor" menu at the top of your screen.
</p>
<p>When Tor is running, Vidalia's dock icon will look like the following:
</p>
<img alt="vidalia running tor"
src="../img/screenshot-osx-vidalia.png"
border="1" width="223" height="100">
<p>Privoxy is installed as part of the Tor bundle package
installer. Once it is installed, it will start automatically when your
computer is restarted.
You do not need to configure Privoxy to use Tor &mdash; a custom Privoxy
configuration for Tor has been installed as part of the installer package.
</p>
<hr>
<a id="using"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#using">Step Two: Configure your applications to use Tor</a></h2>
<br>
<p>After installing Tor and Privoxy, you need to configure your
applications to use them. The first step is to set up web browsing.</p>
<p>If you're using Firefox (we recommend it), check out the <a
href="http://freehaven.net/~squires/torbutton/">Torbutton
plugin</a> that sets everything up for you. If you plan to run Firefox
on a different computer than Tor, read our <a
href="../docs/tor-switchproxy.html.en">Tor SwitchProxy howto</a> to set up
a plugin that makes it easy to switch between using Tor and using a
direct connection.</p>
<h3>Mozilla Firefox</h3>
<p>Otherwise, you need to manually configure your browser's proxy
settings. In Firefox, this is in the Firefox | Preferences menu item,
and then click Connection Settings... in the General tab.</p>
<img src="../img/screenshot-firefox-preferences-1.png" border="1" alt="" width="290" height="245">
<br><br>
<img src="../img/screenshot-firefox-preferences-2.png" border="1" alt="" width="643" height="446">
<br><br>
<p>
You should fill in "localhost"
and "8118" to point the top four protocols to Privoxy, as shown here. (Even
though Privoxy doesn't support FTP and Gopher, <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FtpProxy">you
should set them up anyway</a>.) You should also fill out the socks proxy entry to point directly to Tor ("localhost", "9050", and socks5)
to cover protocols besides the first four. Then click "OK".</p>
</p>
<img src="../img/screenshot-firefox-proxy-settings.png" border="1"
 alt="" width="658" height="508"> <br><br>
<h3>Apple Safari</h3>
<p>If you want to use Tor with Safari, you need to change your
Network Settings. Select your Network Preferences from the Apple |
Location menu:</p>
<img alt="Network settings"
src="../img/screenshot-osx-choose-network.png"
border="1" width="421" height="321">
<p>Select the Network Interface on which you want to enable Tor. If you use
more than one Interface you must change the proxy settings for each
individually.</p>
<img alt="Network preferences"
src="../img/screenshot-osx-choose-interface.png"
border="1" width="595" height="577">
<p>
<p>Select and enter 127.0.0.1 and port 8118 for both
Web Proxy (HTTP) and your Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS).
You should also do this for "FTP Proxy" and "Gopher Proxy"; see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FtpProxy">this
note</a> about Tor and ftp proxies. Leave your Use Passive FTP Mode
(PASV) setting as is.</p>
<img alt="Proxy settings"
src="../img/screenshot-osx-proxy-settings.png"
border="1" width="595" height="577">
<p>Using privoxy is <strong>necessary</strong> because <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">browsers
leak your
DNS requests when they use a SOCKS proxy directly</a>, which is bad for
your anonymity. Privoxy also removes certain dangerous headers from your
web requests, and blocks obnoxious ad sites like Doubleclick.</p>
<p>To Torify other applications that support HTTP proxies, just
point them at Privoxy (that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS
directly (for instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), you can point
your application directly at Tor (localhost port 9050), but see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">this
FAQ entry</a> for why this may be dangerous. For applications
that support neither SOCKS nor HTTP, take a look at <a
href="http://www.taiyo.co.jp/~gotoh/ssh/connect.html">connect</a> or
<a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a>.</p>
<p>For information on how to Torify other applications, check out the
<a href="http://wiki.noreply.org/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO">Torify
HOWTO</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<a id="verify"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#verify">Step Three: Make sure it's working</a></h2>
<br>
<p>
Next, you should try using your browser with Tor and make
sure that your IP address is being anonymized. Click on the <a
href="http://serifos.eecs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/ipaddr.pl?tor=1">Tor
detector</a> and see whether it thinks you're using Tor or not.
(If that site is down, see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#IsMyConnectionPrivate">this
FAQ entry</a> for more suggestions on how to test your Tor.)
</p>
<p>If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's
ability to connect to itself, be sure to allow connections from
your local applications to local port 8118 and port 9050. If
your firewall blocks outgoing connections, punch a hole so
it can connect to at least TCP ports 80 and 443, and then see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FirewalledClient">this
FAQ entry</a>.
</p>
<p>If it's still not working, look at <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ItDoesntWork">this
FAQ entry</a> for hints.</p>

<a id="server"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#server">Step Four: Configure it as a server</a></h2>
<br>
<p>The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more
people who run servers, the faster the Tor network will be. If you have
at least 20 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor by configuring your
Tor to be a server too. We have many features that make Tor servers easy
and convenient, including rate limiting for bandwidth, exit policies so
you can limit your exposure to abuse complaints, and support for dynamic
IP addresses.</p>
<p>Having servers in many different places on the Internet is what
makes Tor users secure. <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ServerAnonymity">You
may also get stronger anonymity yourself</a>,
since remote sites can't know whether connections originated at your
computer or were relayed from others.</p>
<p>Read more at our <a href="../docs/tor-doc-server.html.en">Configuring a server</a>
guide.</p>
<hr>
<a id="uninstall"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#uninstall">How To Uninstall Tor and Privoxy</a></h2>
<br>
<p>The Tor 0.1.0.x series and beyond have a command line or
Terminal-based uninstaller. If you want to remove Tor on OSX, here's how:</p>
<p>Change your application proxy settings back to their original values.
   If you just want to stop using Tor, you can end at this point.</p>
<p>If you want to completely remove Tor, and your account has Admin
Privileges, then proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li> Open up a Terminal or x-term session.</li>
<li> cd /Library/Tor</li>
<li> sudo -s</li>
<li> ./uninstall_tor_bundle.sh</li>
</ol>
<p>Tor and Privoxy are now completely removed from your system.</p>
<p>If you're using a version of the Tor installer that doesn't come
with the uninstall_tor_bundle script, you will need to manually
delete the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>/Library/Tor</li>
<li>/Library/Privoxy</li>
<li>/usr/bin/tor</li>
<li>/usr/bin/tor_resolve</li>
<li>/var/log/tor</li>
<li>/usr/share/man/man1/tor.1</li>
<li>/usr/share/man/man1/tor-resolve.1</li>
<li>/usr/share/man/man1/torify.1</li>
<li>/Library/Receipts/Privoxy.pkg/</li>
<li>/Library/Receipts/privoxyconf.pkg/</li>
<li>/Library/Receipts/Tor.pkg/</li>
<li>/Library/Receipts/torstartup.pkg/</li>
