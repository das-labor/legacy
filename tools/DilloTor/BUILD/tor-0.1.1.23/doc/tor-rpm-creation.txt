These are instructions for building Tor binaries in the rpm format on 
various cpu architectures and operating systems.  Each rpm will require
glibc on the target system.  It is believed that any rpm-based linux 
distribution should have semi-current glibc installed by default.  
If you run into a distribution that does not work with glibc, or does 
not contain it, please let us know the details.  

These are the exact same steps used to build the official rpms of Tor.

If you wish to further tune Tor binaries in rpm format beyond this list, 
see the GCC doc page for further options:
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.0.2/gcc/

The tor.spec.in file contains the basic info needed to tune the binaries
produced in rpm format. The key parameters to tune are located in the
third section of the tor.spec.in file.  Locate the section similar to
this:

## Target a specific arch and OS
#
# default is i386 linux
%define target gnu
%define target_cpu i386
%define target_os linux


The three parameters: target, target_cpu, and target_os are used
throughout the "make dist-rpm" process.  They control the parameters
passed to "configure" and the final tuning of the binaries produced.  
The default settings, as shown above, create binaries for the widest
range of Intel x86 or compatible architectures.

The paramters can be set as follows:

The "target" parameter:
This should be "gnu", "redhat", or the short name of your linux distribution.
Other possibilities are "mandrake" or "suse".  This is passed to
"configure" through the --host, --build, and --target parameters.
Therefore, this "target" parameter must be a valid OS for "configure" as
well.


The "target_cpu" parameter:
This parameter controls the optimization and tuning of your binaries via
gcc and "configure".  This parameter is passed to gcc via the -mtune= or
-mcpu= options.  The "configure" script will also receive this parameter
through the --host, --build, and --target parameters.  Therefore, this
"target_cpu" parameter must be valid for both gcc and "configure".  A
few common options for this parameter may be "athlon64, i686, pentium4" or
others.


The "target_os" parameter:
This parameter controls the target operating system.  Normally, this is
only "linux".  If you wish to build rpms for a non-linux operating
system, you can replace "linux" with your operating system.
