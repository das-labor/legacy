## Configuration file for a typical Tor user
## Last updated 9 February 2006 for Tor 0.1.1.13-alpha.
## (May or may not work for older or newer versions of Tor.)
##
## Lines that begin with "## " try to explain what's going on. Lines
## that begin with just "#" are disabled commands: you can enable them
## by removing the "#" symbol.
##
## See the man page, or http://tor.eff.org/tor-manual-cvs.html, for more
## options you can use in this file.
##
## On Unix, Tor will look for this file in someplace like "~/.tor/torrc" or
## "/etc/torrc"
##
## On Windows, Tor will look for the configuration file in someplace like
## "Application Data\tor\torrc" or "Application Data\<username>\tor\torrc"
##
## With the default Mac OS X installer, Tor will look in ~/.tor/torrc or
## /Library/Tor/torrc


## Replace this with "SocksPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only as a
## server, and not make any local application connections yourself.
SocksPort 9050 # what port to open for local application connections
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1 # accept connections only from localhost
#SocksListenAddress 192.168.0.1:9100 # listen on a chosen IP/port too

## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address.
## First entry that matches wins. If no SocksPolicy is set, we accept
## all (and only) requests from SocksListenAddress.
#SocksPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16
#SocksPolicy reject *

## Logs go to stdout at level "notice" unless redirected by something
## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many Log lines as
## you want.
##
## We advise using "notice" in most cases, since anything more verbose
## may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.
##
## Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/notices.log
#Log notice file @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/notices.log
## Send every possible message to @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/debug.log
#Log debug file @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/debug.log
## Use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles
#Log notice syslog
## To send all messages to stderr:
#Log debug stderr

## Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
## --runasdaemon 1 on the command line. This is ignored on Windows;
## see the FAQ entry if you want Tor to run as an NT service.
#RunAsDaemon 1

## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
#DataDirectory @LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/tor

## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
#ControlPort 9051

############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###

## Look in .../hidden_service/hostname for the address to tell people.
## HiddenServicePort x y:z says to redirect a port x request from the
## client to y:z.

#HiddenServiceDir @LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/tor/hidden_service/
#HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80

#HiddenServiceDir @LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/tor/other_hidden_service/
#HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
#HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
#HiddenServiceNodes moria1,moria2
#HiddenServiceExcludeNodes bad,otherbad

################ This section is just for servers #####################

## NOTE: If you enable these, you should consider mailing your identity
## key fingerprint to the tor-ops, so we can add you to the list of
## servers that clients will trust. See
## http://tor.eff.org/cvs/tor/doc/tor-doc-server.html for details.

## Required: A unique handle for this server
#Nickname ididnteditheconfig

## The IP or fqdn for this server. Leave commented out and Tor will guess.
#Address noname.example.com

## Contact info that will be published in the directory, so we can
## contact you if you need to upgrade or if something goes wrong.
## This is optional but recommended.
#ContactInfo Random Person <nobody AT example dot com>
## You might also include your PGP or GPG fingerprint if you have one:
#ContactInfo 1234D/FFFFFFFF Random Person <nobody AT example dot com>

## Required: what port to advertise for tor connections
#ORPort 9001
## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised
## in ORPort (e.g. to advertise 443 but bind to 9090), uncomment
## the line below. You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding
## yourself to make this work.
#ORListenAddress 0.0.0.0:9090

## Uncomment this to mirror the directory for others. Please do
## if you have enough bandwidth: see the bottom of
## http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#LimitBandwidth
#DirPort 9030 # what port to advertise for directory connections
## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised
## in DirPort (e.g. to advertise 80 but bind 9091), uncomment the line
## below. You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding yourself
## to make this work.
#DirListenAddress 0.0.0.0:9091

## Uncomment this if you run more than one Tor server, and add the
## nickname of each Tor server you control, even if they're on different
## networks. We declare it here so clients can avoid using more than
## one of your servers in a given circuit.
#MyFamily nickname1,nickname2,...

## A comma-separated list of exit policies. They're considered first
## to last, and the first match wins. If you want to _replace_
## the default exit policy, end this with either a reject *:* or an
## accept *:*. Otherwise, you're _augmenting_ (prepending to) the
## default exit policy. Leave commented to just use the default, which is
## available in the man page or at http://tor.eff.org/documentation.html
##
## Look at http://tor.eff.org/faq-abuse.html#TypicalAbuses
## for issues you might encounter if you use the default exit policy.
##
## If certain IPs and ports are blocked externally, e.g. by your firewall,
## you should update your exit policy to reflect this -- otherwise Tor
## users will be told that those destinations are down.
##
#ExitPolicy accept *:6660-6667,reject *:* # allow irc ports but no more
#ExitPolicy accept *:119 # accept nntp as well as default exit policy
#ExitPolicy reject *:* # middleman only -- no exits allowed
