# not a psueber-pretty uninstall script for the Tor bundle package
#	. this currently leaves ~/.tor, /var/log/tor and empty
#		directories /Library/Tor, /Library/Privoxy (see comment below)
#	. this relies on the fact that the startup items directories (if any)
#		will be named the same as the package name (ie. Tor)

# comments
# loki: because of the way the Tor package installs itself (the root directory
#	is the filesystem root, as opposed to the much nicer way that privoxy
#	installs itself with the privoxy home (/Library/Privoxy) as its
#	install root directory), i thought it more prudent to leave empty
#	directories laying around rather than try to incorrectly intuit from
#	the bom contents what directories should exist and which ones could be
#	deleted (ie, the Tor package has /Library listed in its bom --
#	obviously this is a Bad Thing(tm) to delete).
#       + when the Tor installer is changed, this uninstaller could be modified.
# loki: /bin/ps, when run from a terminal window in osX, restricts information
#	based on the width of the window. an 80 col window will stupidly cause
#	the grep search for the privoxy pid to not find the pid, whereas the grep
#	in a wider window succeeds. consider using killall. in the meantime,
#	advise uninstall runners to drag wide their terminal window.. ugh
