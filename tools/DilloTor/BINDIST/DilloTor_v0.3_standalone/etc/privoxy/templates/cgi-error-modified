# No-Such-Domain Error Output template for Privoxy.
#
#
# USING HTML TEMPLATES:
# ---------------------
#
# Template files are written win plain HTML, with a few
# additions:
# 
# - Lines that start with a '#' character like this one
#   are ignored
#
# - Each item in the below list of exported symbols will
#   be replaced by dynamically generated text, if they
#   are enclosed in '@'-characters. E.g. The string @version@
#   will be replaced by the version number of Privoxy.
#
# - One special application of this is to make whole blocks
#   of the HTML template disappear if the condition <name>
#   is not given. Simply enclose the block between the two
#   strings @if-<name>start and if-<name>-end@. The strings
#   should be placed in HTML comments (<!-- -->), so the
#   html structure won't be messed when the magic happens.
#   
# USABLE SYMBOLS IN THIS TEMPLATE:

        <h2>URL out of date - file has changed since it was generated</h2>
        <p>The URL you're viewing is out of date.  To prevent possible
           damage to your configuration file, this action has been ignored.
        </p>
        <p>Possible causes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you got here using your browser's "back" button, then
             that is deliberately disabled for this page.  Please 
             navigate around the configuration editor using the
             links provided.</li>
          <li>Perhaps you've got more than one browser window open, and
             you're trying to change the same file in both?  You can
             only have one editor window open at a time.  Your other edit
             window should continue to function.</li>
          <li>You may have modified the file some other way - perhaps by
             editing it with a text editor.  Simply go back in to the 
             configuration interface using the links below.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can go back into the edit interface using the menu below,
           or by clicking <a href="edit-actions-list?f=@f@">here</a>.
