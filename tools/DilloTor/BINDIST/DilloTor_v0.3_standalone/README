1. WHAT IS IT?

DilloTor is a way to anonymously surf on the internet using tor (http://tor.eff.org/), privoxy (http://www.privoxy.org/) and Dillo (http://dillo.org/) as browser.
The project was inspired by the TorPark-Project (http://www.freehaven.net/~arrakis/torpark.html). As well as TorPark, DilloTor is indended to be an easy way of instant anonymous surfing on the web. The main differences are: DilloTor runs on x86-Linux, TorPark runs on Windows. DilloTor uses dillo as webbrowser, TorPark uses Firefox 1.5 (DeerPark).
It is intended to run from a pluggable flash device or any other removable storage device. This won't work for a CD because Tor needs a local directory to write to. Since you don't want to leave tracks on the computer you are using, Tor is set to write to their local directory. And since a CD can't readily be written to, the program will terminate.



2. WHY IS IT?

As I use computers running Windows(TM) and Linux that do not belong to me for surfing, I don't want to leave more tracks as strictly nessesary. 
For Windows(TM) there is TorPark, which is great, for Linux there was nothing. So there is DilloTor.


3. WHY DILLO?
Dillo is lightweight. I wanted to use Firefox, too, but since I needed a static binary, Firefox did not make it. Dillo lacks some rendering features, will say, web pages sometimes look horrible. Nevertheless, it is very usable, as you might want to access mostly 'information' as in 'text' and not 'pictures' or 'movies' as in 'pr0n'. Most important, dillo is very small (1,5 MB static binary).
REMARK: http_proxy is set to 127.0.0.1:8118 at compile time

4. HOW TO USE:

1. Download the tar.gz 
2. Unpack the archive and place the DilloTor folder  onto a rewritable media, like a USB keychain drive.
3. Run starttor.sh.
4. When you are through surfing, run stoptor.sh to end all processes associated with Torpark.

5. LIMITATIONS:


1. Unsolved bookmark issue:
DO NOT USE BOOKMARKS! I did a change to the dillo code to stop it writing in a .dillo directory it used to place in your home directory. I did not care about the bookmarks, yet. SO: DO NOT USE BOOKMARKS!

2. The Tor version used is tor-0.1.1.12-alpha. I would like to lay an emphasis on the word 'alpha'. It does not mean 'stable'. I did not encounter any problems, though.

3. When placed on a FAT[16/32] the files lose their permissions. Bad thing, e.g. as the var/run/ directory has to be writable.
This all is also dependant of the permission the volume is mounted with. Again, for me it works at the moment, I hope to find a better solution (like using a tar.gz and unpacking it on the fly to a tempdir, where we wipe it afterwards or something...)
