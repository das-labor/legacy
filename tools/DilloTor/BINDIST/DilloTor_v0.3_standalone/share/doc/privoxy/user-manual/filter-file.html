> All text substitutions that can be invoked through the
 <VAR

 selected through the <VAR

HREF="config.html#FILTERFILE"

 option.</P
><P
> Typical reasons for doing such substitutions are to eliminate
 common annoyances in HTML and JavaScript, such as pop-up windows,
 exit consoles, crippled windows without navigation tools, the
 infamous &#60;BLINK&#62; tag etc, to suppress images with certain
 width and height attributes (standard banner sizes or web-bugs),
 or just to have fun. The possibilities are endless.</P
><P
> Filtering works on any text-based document type, including 
 HTML, JavaScript, CSS etc. (all <VAR

 MIME types, <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

CLASS="EMPHASIS"

 Substitutions are made at the source level, so if you want to <SPAN

><P
> Just like the <A
HREF="actions-file.html"
>actions files</A
>, the
 filter file is organized in sections, which are called <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

 here. Each filter consists of a heading line, that starts with the
 <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>keyword</I
></SPAN
> <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FILTER:</VAR
>, followed by
 the filter's <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>name</I
></SPAN
>, and a short (one line) 
 <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>description</I
></SPAN
> of what it does. Below that line
 come the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>jobs</I

 text substitutions. By convention, the name of a filter
 should describe what the filter <SPAN

>eliminates</I
></SPAN
>. The
 comment is used in the <A

><P
> Once a filter called <VAR

><P
> Following the header line and a comment, you see the job. Note that it uses
 <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"

CLASS="LITERAL"
>/</VAR
>, because
 the pattern contains a forward slash, which would otherwise have to be escaped
 by a backslash (<VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\</VAR
>).</P
><P
> Now, let's examine the pattern: it starts with the text <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&#60;script.*</VAR
>
 enclosed in parentheses. Since the dot matches any character, and <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>*</VAR
>
 means: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Match an arbitrary number of the element left of myself"</SPAN
>, this
 matches <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#60;script"</SPAN
>, followed by <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>any</I
></SPAN
> text, i.e.
 it matches the whole page, from the start of the first &#60;script&#62; tag.</P
><P
> That's more than we want, but the pattern continues: <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>document\.referrer</VAR
>
 matches only the exact string <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>. The dot needed to
 be <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>escaped</I
></SPAN
>, i.e. preceded by a backslash, to take away its
 special meaning as a joker, and make it just a regular dot. So far, the meaning is:
 Match from the start of the first &#60;script&#62; tag in a the page, up to, and including,
 the text <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>, if <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>both</I
></SPAN
> are present
 in the page (and appear in that order).</P
><P
> But there's still more pattern to go. The next element, again enclosed in parentheses,
 is <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*&#60;/script&#62;</VAR
>. You already know what <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*</VAR
>
 means, so the whole pattern translates to: Match from the start of the first  &#60;script&#62;
 tag in a page to the end of the last &#60;script&#62; tag, provided that the text
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
> appears somewhere in between.</P
><P
> This is still not the whole story, since we have ignored the options and the parentheses:
 The portions of the page matched by sub-patterns that are enclosed in parentheses, will be
 remembered and be available through the variables <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1, $2, ...</VAR
> in
 the substitute. The <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>U</VAR
> option switches to ungreedy matching, which means
 that the first <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*</VAR
> in the pattern will only <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"eat up"</SPAN
> all
 text in between <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#60;script"</SPAN
> and the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>first</I
></SPAN
> occurrence
 of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>, and that the second <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*</VAR
> will
 only span the text up to the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>first</I
></SPAN
> <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#60;/script&#62;"</SPAN
>
 tag. Furthermore, the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>s</VAR
> option says that the match may span
 multiple lines in the page, and the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>g</VAR
> option again means that the
 substitution is global.</P
><P
> So, to summarize, the pattern means: Match all scripts that contain the text
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>. Remember the parts of the script from
 (and including) the start tag up to (and excluding) the string
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
> as <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1</VAR
>, and the part following
 that string, up to and including the closing tag, as <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$2</VAR
>.</P
><P
> Now the pattern is deciphered, but wasn't this about substituting things? So
 lets look at the substitute: <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1"Not Your Business!"$2</VAR
> is
 easy to read: The text remembered as <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1</VAR
>, followed by 
 <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"Not Your Business!"</VAR
> (<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>including</I
></SPAN
>
 the quotation marks!), followed by the text remembered as <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$2</VAR
>.
 This produces an exact copy of the original string, with the middle part
 (the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>) replaced by <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"Not Your
 Business!"</VAR
>.</P
><P
> The whole job now reads: Replace <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
> by
 <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"Not Your Business!"</VAR
> wherever it appears inside a
 &#60;script&#62; tag. Note that this job won't break JavaScript syntax,
 since both the original and the replacement are syntactically valid
 string objects. The script just won't have access to the referrer
 information anymore.</P
><P
> We'll show you two other jobs from the JavaScript taming department, but
 this time only point out the constructs of special interest:</P

> <VAR

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"zero

CLASS="LITERAL"
>?</VAR

CLASS="LITERAL"

>
 makes this matching of arbitrary text ungreedy. (Note that the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>U</VAR
>
 option is not set). The <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>['"]</VAR
> construct means: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"a single
 <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>or</I
></SPAN
> a double quote"</SPAN
>. Finally, <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\1</VAR
> is
 a backreference to the first parenthesis just like <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1</VAR
> above,
 with the difference that in the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>pattern</I
></SPAN
>, a backslash indicates
 a backreference, whereas in the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>substitute</I
></SPAN
>, it's the dollar.</P
><P
> So what does this job do? It replaces assignments of single- or double-quoted
 strings to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"window.status"</SPAN
> object with a dummy assignment
 (using a variable name that is hopefully odd enough not to conflict with
 real variables in scripts). Thus, it catches many cases where e.g. pointless
 descriptions are displayed in the status bar instead of the link target when
 you move your mouse over links.</P

>    Webbugs are small, invisible images (technically 1X1 GIF images), that 
    are used to track users across websites, and collect information on them.
    As an HTML page is loaded by the browser, an embedded image tag causes the
    browser to contact a third-party site, disclosing the tracking information
    through the requested URL and/or cookies for that third-party domain, without
    the use ever becoming aware of the interaction with the third-party site.
    HTML-ized spam also uses a similar technique to verify email addresses.

    It is not necessary when using MS products, and will cause corruption of

    worthwhile for Europeans on non-MS platforms, if wierd garbage characters
