       <SPAN

       issues. There is a webview of the CVS hierarchy at <A

       which might help with visualizing how these pieces fit together.
     </P

>       Branches are used to fork a sub-development path from the main trunk.
       Within the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>current</VAR
> module where the sources are, there
       is always at least one <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"branch"</SPAN
> from the main trunk
       devoted to a stable release series. The main trunk is where active
       development takes place for the next stable series (e.g. 3.2.x).
       So just prior to each stable series (e.g. 3.0.x), a branch is created
       just for stable series releases (e.g. 3.0.0 -&#62; 3.0.1 -&#62; 3.0.2, etc).
       Once the initial stable release of any stable branch has taken place,
       this branch is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>only used for bugfixes</I
></SPAN
>, which have
       had prior testing before being committed to CVS. (See <A
HREF="newrelease.html#VERSIONNUMBERS"
>Version Numbers</A
> below for details on
       versioning.)
     </P
><P
>       This will result in at least two active branches, which means there may
       be occasions that require the same (or similar) item to be 
       checked into to two different places (assuming its a bugfix and needs 
       fixing in both the stable and unstable trees). This also means that in
       order to have access to both trees, both will have to be checked out 
       separately. Use the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cvs -r</VAR
> flag to check out a 
       branch, e.g: <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cvs co -r v_3_0_branch current</VAR
>.

        be made to ensure that it is readable, compilable and consistent at all
        times. There are differing guidelines for the stable branch and the
        main development trunk, and we ask anyone with CVS access to strictly
        adhere to the following guidelines:
