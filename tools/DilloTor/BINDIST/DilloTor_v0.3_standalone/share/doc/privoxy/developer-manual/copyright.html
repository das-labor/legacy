 by Anonymous Coders and <A

 web advertising and user tracking.</P

 forcing  users to consume ads, give up autonomy over their browsing, and
 for spying on them, kept evolving. Unfortunately, the <SPAN

 Fortunately, it had been released under the GNU

 development by others.</P

 It could already replace banners with a transparent image, and had a first
 version of pop-up killing, but it was still very closely based on the
 original, with all its limitations, such as the lack of HTTP/1.1 support,
 flexible per-site configuration, or content modification. The last release
 from this effort was version 2.0.2-10, published in 2000.</P
><P
> Then, some
 <A

 picked up the thread, and started turning the software inside out, upside down,
 and then reassembled it, adding many

 stable version, 3.0, was released August, 2002.
