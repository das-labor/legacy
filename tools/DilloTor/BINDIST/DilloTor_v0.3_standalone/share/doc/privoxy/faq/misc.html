 The actual processing time required by <SPAN

 noticeable on slow dialup connections.

 address with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 server needs to know your IP address to send the answers back to you. </P
><P
> Fortunately there are many publicly usable anonymous proxies out there, which
 solve the problem by providing a further level of indirection between you and
 the web server, shared by many people, and thus letting your requests "drown"
 in white noise of unrelated requests as far as user tracking is concerned.</P
><P
> Most of them will, however, log your IP address and make it available to the
 authorities in case you abuse that anonymity for criminal purposes. In fact
 you can't even rule out that some of them only exist to *collect* information
 on (those suspicious) people with a more than average preference for privacy.</P
><P
> You can find a list of anonymous public proxies at <A
HREF="http://www.multiproxy.org/anon_list.htm"

 more through Google. A particularly interesting project is the JAP service

></H3
><P
> No. Your chances of remaining anonymous are greatly improved, but unless you
 are an expert on Internet security it would be safest to assume that
 everything you do on the Web can be traced back to you.</P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can remove various information about you,
 and allows <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>you</I
></SPAN
> more freedom  to decide which sites 
 you can trust, and what details you want to reveal. But it's still possible
 that web sites can find out who you are. Here's one way this can happen.</P
><P
> A few browsers disclose the user's email address in certain situations, such
 as when transferring a file by FTP. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 does not filter FTP. If you need this feature, or are concerned about the
 mail handler of your browser disclosing your email address, you might
 consider products such as <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>NSClean</SPAN
>.</P
><P
> Browsers available only as binaries could use non-standard headers to give
 out any information they can have access to: see the manufacturer's license
 agreement. It's impossible to anticipate and prevent every breach of privacy
 that might occur. The professionally paranoid prefer browsers available as
 source code, because anticipating their behavior is easier. Trust the source,

NAME="AEN609"
>4.8. Might some things break because header information or
content is being altered?</A
></H3
><P
> Definitely. More and more sites use HTTP header content to decide what to
 display and how to display it. There is many ways that this can be handled, 
 so having hard and fast rules, is tricky.</P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"User-Agent"</SPAN
> in particular is often used in this way to identify
 the browser, and adjust content accordingly. Changing this now (at least not
 further than removing the OS information) is not recommended, since so many
 sites do look for it. You may get undesirable results by changing this.</P
><P
> For instance, different browsers use different encodings of Russian and Czech
 characters, certain web servers convert pages on-the-fly according to the
 User Agent header. Giving a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"User Agent"</SPAN
> with the wrong
 operating system or browser manufacturer causes some sites in these languages
 to be garbled; Surfers to Eastern European sites should change it to
 something closer. And then some page access counters work by looking at the
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Referer"</SPAN
> header; they may fail or break if unavailable. The
 weather maps of Intellicast have been blocked by their server when no
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Referer"</SPAN
> or cookie is provided, is another example. (But you
 can forge both headers without giving information away). There are
 many other ways things can go wrong when trying to fool a web server.</P
><P
> Similar thoughts apply to modifying JavaScript, and, to a lesser degree,
 HTML elements.</P
><P
> If you have problems with a site, you will have to adjust your configuration 
 accordingly. Cookies are probably the most likely adjustment that may 
 be required, but by no means the only one.</P

ads used to be. Why?</A
></H3
><P
> It would be technically possible eliminate the banners in a way that frees
 their screen estate in many cases, by doing all banner blocking with filters,
 i.e. eliminating the whole image references from the HTML pages instead
 of letting them stay in, and blocking the resulting requests for the
 banners themselves.</P
><P
> But this would consume considerable CPU resources, would likely destroy
 the layout of many web pages which rely on the banners consuming a certain
 amount of screen space, and would fail in other cases, where the screen space
 is reserved e.g. by tables anyway. Also, making the banners disappear without
 a visual trace complicates troubleshooting.</P

 define appropriate filters yourself.</P

 there is little that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 gibberish data though from one end to the other unprocessed.</P
><P
> The only exception to this is blocking by host patterns, as the client needs
 to tell <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> the name of the remote server,
 so that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can establish the connection.
 If that name matches a host-only pattern, the connection will be blocked.</P
><P
> As far as ad blocking is concerned, this is less of a restriction than it may
 seem, since ad sources are often identifiable by the host name, and often
 the banners to be placed in an encrypted page come unencrypted nonetheless
 for efficiency reasons, which exposes them to the full power of 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 <SPAN

 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 Internet in this configuration. If you want to have
 <SPAN

 be opened up to allow for LAN requests. In this case, we'd recommend
 you specify only the LAN gateway address, e.g. 192.168.1.1, in the main

 in the browser proxy configuration, but <SPAN
