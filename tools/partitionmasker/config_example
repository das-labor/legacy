# Example configuration file for partitionmasker

# Note that this config file is just a piece of ruby code evaluated
# by partitionmasker.

# GLOBAL OPTIONS

# **Option reuse_loops, same as -L, --reuse-loops on the command line
#  Reuse existing intermediary ro/rw loop devices for the source.
#  Only use this option if you are sure that any existing loops onto
#  the source do not have an offset into the source and will not
#  change their read-write status later on.
# Defaulting to false, don't reuse loops
##Config.reuse_loops = true

# **Option verbose, same as -v, --verbose on the command line
#  show what is being done. Show the table passed to dmsetup.
# Defaulting to false
##Config.verbose = true

# **Option fake, same as -f, --fake on the command line
#  don't call any tools that actually change the system,
#  fake output of these calls. Nice for debugging and learning.
#  This implies -v
# Defaulting to false
##Config.fake = true

# MAPPINGS

#Create a device "/dev/mapper/virthd", mapping contents of "/dev/sda"
Device.create do
  source("/dev/sda")
  target "virthd"

  #map first primary partition read-write
  add_rw_mapping("/dev/sda1")

  #map first logical partition read-write
  add_rw_mapping("/dev/sda5") do
    #...but only if file system/swap/LVM physical volume
    #has the expected UUID
    is_uuid("01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-4567890abcde")
    #this will check if "/dev/disks/by-uuid/<uuid above>" is a symlink
    #to "/dev/sda5", refusing operation if not.
  end
