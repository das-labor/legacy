ABOUT

web_trakkcor is a server-side component for Trakkcor (http://www.trakkcor.ch/).
It uses OpenStreetMap to show the position Trakkcor last submitted to the server.
It is kind of hackish, not written with any security in mind and provided as is 
(see LICENSE).

USAGE:
Place folder content on webserver (PHP required, "view/position.csv" must be writeable 
for the webserver).
Set trakkcor to use the following URL for posting http://your_server/path/to/record.php
Set posting method to GET, data format to GPGGA.
record.php writes the file http://your_server/path/to/view/position.csv
To view the position Trakkcor submitted point your browser to
http://your_server/path/to/view/index.php (javascript must be enabled)


ALTERNATIVE:
While record.php is a logger for trakkcor, record_GET.php is a generic logger. 
To post data, use something like the following URL/GET-Request:
http://your_server/path/to/record_GET.php?id=&ts=&lat=&lon=&alt=&hea=&spd=
where 
'id' is a generice string to identify the log source (make up you own)
'ts' is a timestamp (format: HHMMSS)
'lat' is latitude as float
'lon' is longitude as float
'alt' is altitude as float (you get the pattern, I guess)
'hea' is direction (string, float, whatever)
'spd' is speed as float
