UBERSHOWCASE

ABOUT:
Ubershowcase is a web gallery creator written in ruby using rMagick, exifr and builder.
It is a simple "drag the stuff in a folder, I'll take care of the rest"-solution.
For the front-end the Thickbox framework is used.

FEATURES:

- 	Creates thumbnails (size of choice)
- 	Client-side resizing of big images according to the users screen size 
	(never touches the original! usable to browse your photo archive without having to 
	worry about your precious originals)
-	Reads and displays EXIF data in a convenient way
-	Static web pages. It's hard to exploit xhtml and css, right?
	Low load on server, as there is no need for re-rendering of pages and images on every view
-	Thickbox as shiny AJAX klickbunt front-end. 


USAGE:
1.	Copy the ubershowcase folder to a location accessible by your webserver
2.	Edit some settings in the ubershowcase script
	@ROOTDIR = "/path/to/your/ubershowcase/directory/"
	@GTITLE = "Ubershowcase - lets rock!"
	DFILE = "_info.txt" (optional, see below)
	there is more your can change, but change at least the path!
3.	Each of your galleries should be a folder containing images
	Place them in /path/to/your/ubershowcase/directory/galleries/
4.	You can add some information to your image sets by placing file called _info.txt
	in your galleries-folder and in each of its subfolders. You may use (x)html in these files.
	The filename is specified via the constant DFILE (see above). You may change it, if you like
	The content of _info.txt in your galleries folder show on your ubershowcase frontend.
5.	Make sure all libraries are there. You need:
	- RMagick (check if your Linux distribution comes with a pre-compiled version, else compile it yourself)
	- exifr (via ruby gems)
	- builder (via ruby gems)
6.	Run the ubershowcase script.
