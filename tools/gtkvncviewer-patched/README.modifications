Hi,

this is a hacked version of the files of the Ubuntu 9.04 packet
gtkvncviewer
in version 0.4-1. It expands the "Send keys" menu by the most
important key combinations on a german keyboard that need a working
AltR (AltGr) key. It is not a fix but an ugly workaround.

The modifications are under the same license as the original software
and given without any warranty.

Replace the files in /usr/share/gtkvncviewer by these modified ones.
