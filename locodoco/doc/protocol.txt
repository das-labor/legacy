LOCODOCO PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION 1.0
=========================================================================

1  General description

   The locodoco protocol is designed to establish a reliable way of communication
   between locodoco devices and the master unit (base station). In order to
   avoid collisions, the protocol utilizes timeslots.

   In general a protocol run is divided into two periods: Master sending
   phase and client sending phase. While the master phase may be of variable
   length, the client sending phase is divided into fixed-length timeslots for
   each client.

   Here's an example protocol run:

   +---------+------+----+---+   +- C0 -+ (C1) +- C2 -+ (C3) + (C4) +- C5 -+
   | CMD0    | CMD1 |CMD2|END|   |RESP0 |      |RESP1 |             :RESP3 |
   +---------+------+----+---+   +------+      +------+      +      +------+
   End of master timeslot -'        |       |            |      |   |
   |- Master timeslot  -----|       |     [Empty/Unused timeslots]  |
                Grace period |---|  [Reponseses from Clients 0, 2 & 5]
   
   Note: Due to varying data rates for implementations, timeslot lengths are
   denoted in bytes, rather than absolute times.

1.1 Timeslot assignment

   Timeslots are requested by clients via a "timeslot assignment request" and
   are assigned by the master via the "timeslot assignment acknowledge". For the
   purpose of timeslot assignment, 4 additional timeslots with a fixed length of
   12 bytes each are resrved for this type of request.
   When subscribing to a network, the client must choose the timeslot for its
   assignment request at random in order to prevent collisions the event that
   multiple devices are powered on at the same time.


1.1.1 Timeslot overlapping

   Timeslots may be assigned in a manner that they overlap if the clients using
   these timelots are able to perform channel occupancy detection. When detecting
   that the channel is occupied, a client should refrain from sending and schedule
   the packet for transmission in the next cycle.


   
1.2 Packet format
   
   |  8b  |  8b  |  8b  |    16b    |    16b    |len-3 Bytes|
   +------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+--  ...  --+
   |      |      |      |           |           |           |
   | LEN  | TYPE |LTYPE | CHECKSUM  |  ADDRESS  | PAYLOAD   |
   |      |      |      |           |           |           |
   +------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+--  ...  --+

   The basic packet format contains three addional bytes (LTYPE and ADDRESS)
   that indicate the locodoco command to follow and the source/destination address.
   Some commands have an implicit fixed length, while others may need the LEN field
   in order to determine length of the command. Since the length field is (in most
   cases) already set from the underlying device driver or protocol, the field is
   never omitted.



2 Commands

   The address field contains the address of the sending or receiving client device.
   All clients communicate exclusively with the master and destination/source address
   is therefore implicitly the master address (0x0000).
   
   Some commands require to be acknowledged by the target device. Unless
   otherwise noted, a reply from the target device is made by sending the
   same command again with its own address set in the address field. Transmission
   of the payload data may be omitted in acknowledgement packets and should
   not be checked on the receipient side.

   In general, two distinct command types exist: Query and setting commands.
   An acknowledgement to a set-command is signalled by sending an empty package
   with the same LTYPE field. Queries are responded to by sending a package
   with the same LTYPE field and the response included in the payload field.

   0x18,0x28         6       Drive-to command

   
   
2.1.1 Command "Emergency stop"
   
   All devies must stop their engines immediately when receiving this command.
   Peripheral devices, such as lighting or smoke generators may be left in their
   current state.


2.1.2 Command "End of master timeslot countdown"

   The countdown marks the end of the base/master timeslot and includes the maximum
   amount of bytes that are to be sent within the timeslot (thereby, implicitly the
   timeslot length).
   The command may be sent multiple times (each with decremented countdown value)
   by the master in order to improve reliability. When transmitting the command
   mutliple times, the master must send the command with the appropriate delay in
   between the messages.
   
   
2.1.3 Timeslot assignment request
   
   Whenever a client node enters a cell, it requires a timeslot in order to respond
   to master commands.

   The address field for the request should be set to the desired/old address.

   The payload field contains 5 additional bytes as follows:

   * Byte 0:     Capability flags
    ** bit 0: when set, this indicates that the device is able to perform channel
              occupancy detection.
    ** bits 1-7: unused/RFU

   * Bytes 1-4:  UUID of device
     This field includes the unique ID of the device


2.1.4 Timeslot assignment acknowledge
   
   This message is used to assign a timeslot to a client node or change its current
   timeslot. If the client requested a timeslot, the master sets the address field
   to address 0x0000 - in this case, a client must temporarily accept & parse commands
   sent to this address.
   If the master needs to change the timeslot, the client address should be set to the
   current address of the client, since the client already is in active mode at that
   time.

   In any case, the client must check if the UUID of the timeslot assignment command
   matches its UUID and upon successful check, must set the timeslot and address
   accordingly.


2.1.5 Resume operation
   
   This command is the inverse to the emergency stop command and instructs the devices
   to resume operation.


2.1.6 Disassociation
   
   Whenever a device leaves a cell, the client should send the disassociation command
   to let the master know that it may re-use the assigned timeslot for another device.


2.1.7 Configuration blob setting / query
   
   This command is used to set or query the device-specific configuration blob. The
   first two bytes of the payload field denote the offset of the data in the following
   bytes. The length of the response or request is implicitly given as:
   	lenth - header_size - 2


2.1.8 Reboot command
   
   This command instructs the device to reboot and execute the bootloader.


2.1.9 Initiate calibration

   This command starts the speed calibration process of the loco decoder. The loco will
   drive forward until it reaches the first waypoint, start a timer and then measure the
   time until it reaches the next waypoint. The distance between the two waypoints is set
   in the two payload bytes of this command.


2.1.10 Light control

   The light control message contains 4 bytes - some of them have fixed functionality,
   all others may be freely assigned.

   The following table denotes the bits and their meaning. Bits are counted from right
   to left.

   BIT   FUNCTION
   0,1   0x0 all lighting off
         0x1 automatic front/rear lighting according to direction, front/rear cabin lights on
         0x2 automatic front/read lighting according to direction, front/rear cabin lights off
         0x3 manual front/rear lighting
    2    passenger cabin / engine room / center light
    3    front cabin light (cabin light for locos with one cabin)
    4    back cabin light
    5    front light white
    6    front light red
    7    additional front light (i.e. spotlight)
    8    back light white
    9    back light red
   10    additional back light (i.e. spotlight)
   11    gear lighting
   13    siren light 1
   14    siren light 2
   14    oven fire

   14,15 RFU
   16-31 freely assignable
   
   Note: Locos with only one driver cabin should adhere to the front cabin light command

2.1.11 Servo control
   
   The servo control command is used to assign a servo into a given position. The
   unit is permille, instead of degrees, because the master has no way of knowing the
   total values of servo positioning.

   The payload bytes are interpreted as follows:
   * Byte 0: Servo ID
   * Byte 1: Transition time in 100ms steps
   * Bytes 2,3: Position (permille)


2.1.12 Coupler control
  
   The coupler control message is used to engage/release the couplers. A set bit denotes
   the release of the coupler, a cleared bit denotes the "normal" position.

   The distinct bits of the payload byte is interpreted as follows:
   
   * bit 0: coupler front
   * bit 1: coupler back
   * bits 2-7: unused / RFU


2.1.13 Pantograph control
   
   The pantograph control message is used to lower or raise the pantographs. Locos
   with only one pantograph should adhere to the front pantograph command.

   * bit 0: pantograph front
   * bit 1: pantograph rear
   * bits 2-7: unused


2.1.14 Smoke generator control
   
   The smoke generator message en- or disables the smoke generators. A set bit (1) enables
   the function, a cleared bit (0) disables it.

   * bit 0: front/main smoke generator
   * bit 1: back smoke generator
   * bit 2: additional smoke generator 1
   * bit 3: additional smoke generator 2
   ...
   * bit 7: additional smoke generator 6


2.1.15 Speed control / Target speed setting

   There are two commands available for speed control: One is used to immediately set the speed,
   the other is used to slowly in- or decrease the speed according to the loco's parameters.

   The two payload bytes of both commands are interpreted as the speed value that is to be set.


2.1.16 Position set & report

   Clients may report their poistion (without a perceeding request from the master) by sending
   a position report message (0x26). The first 2 bytes of the payload indicate the waypoint ID
   of the last recognized waypoint, followed by 2 bytes denoting the distance in millimeters that
   the loco has travelled since passing the waypoint.

   A position value of -1 (0xFFFF) indicates that the loco is unaware of its current position.

   Note that the position may also be set by the master through the position set command (0x16), for
   example when the loco is powered on at a known position (train yard, shed, etc.).


2.1.17 Drive-to command

   The drive-to command instructs the loco to drive to a given waypoint and then either report
   its position or stop at a given position behind the waypoint.

   The first 4 bytes of the payload contain the target waypoint ID, the last 2 bytes denote the
   distance (in mm) that the loco should pass until stopping. If the distance value is set to -1
   (0xFFFF), the loco does not change its speed, but will report its position immediately after
   having reached the waypoint.
