LOCODOCO PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION 1.0
=========================================================================

1) Packet format
   
   |  8b  |  8b  |  8b  |    16b    |    16b    |len-2 Bytes|
   +------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+--  ...  --+
   |      |      |      |           |           |           |
   | TYPE | LEN  |LTYPE | CHECKSUM  |  ADDRESS  | PAYLOAD   |
   |      |      |      |           |           |           |
   +------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+--  ...  --+

   The basic packet format contains only one addional field (LTYPE) that
   denotes the locodoco command to follow. Some commands have an implicit
   fixed length, while others may need the LEN field in order to determine
   length of the command.



2) Commands
   
   Some commands require to be acknowledged by the target device. Unless
   otherwise noted, a reply from the target device is made by sending the
   same command again with its own address as target address. Transmission
   of the payload data may be omitted in acknowledgement packets and should
   not be checked on the receipient side.

   In general, two distinct command types exist: Query and setting commands.
   An acknowledgement to a set-command is signalled by sending an empty package
   with the same LTYPE field. Queries are responded to by sending a package
   with the same LTYPE field and the response included in the payload field.
