LOCODOCO PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION 1.0
=========================================================================

1  General description

   The locodoco protocol is designed to establish a reliable way of communication
   between locodoco devices and the master unit (base station). In order to
   avoid collisions, the protocol utilizes timeslots.

   In general a protocol run is divided into two periods: Master sending
   phase and client sending phase. While the master phase may be of variable
   length, the client sending phase is divided into fixed-length timeslots for
   each client.

   Here's an example protocol run:

   +---------+------+----+---+   +- C0 -+ (C1) +- C2 -+ (C3) + (C4) +- C5 -+
   | CMD0    | CMD1 |CMD2|END|   |RESP0 |      |RESP1 |             :RESP3 |
   +---------+------+----+---+   +------+      +------+      +      +------+
   End of master timeslot -'        |       |            |      |   |
   |- Master timeslot  -----|       |     [Empty/Unused timeslots]  |
                Grace period |---|  [Reponseses from Clients 0, 2 & 5]
   
   Note: Due to varying data rates for implementations, timeslot lengths are
   denoted in bytes, rather than absolute times.

1.1 Timeslot assignment

   Timeslots are requested by clients via a "timeslot assignment request" and
   are assigned by the master via the "timeslot assignment acknowledge". For the
   purpose of timeslot assignment, 4 additional timeslots with a fixed length of
   12 bytes each are resrved for this type of request.
   When subscribing to a network, the client must choose the timeslot for its
   assignment request at random in order to prevent collisions the event that
   multiple devices are powered on at the same time.


1.1.1 Timeslot overlapping

   Timeslots may be assigned in a manner that they overlap if the clients using
   these timelots are able to perform channel occupancy detection. When detecting
   that the channel is occupied, a client should refrain from sending and schedule
   the packet for transmission in the next cycle.


   
1.2 Packet format
   
   |  8b  |  8b  |  8b  |    16b    |    16b    |len-3 Bytes|
   +------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+--  ...  --+
   |      |      |      |           |           |           |
   | TYPE | LEN  |LTYPE | CHECKSUM  |  ADDRESS  | PAYLOAD   |
   |      |      |      |           |           |           |
   +------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+--  ...  --+

   The basic packet format contains three addional bytes (LTYPE and ADDRESS)
   that indicate the locodoco command to follow and the source/destination address.
   Some commands have an implicit fixed length, while others may need the LEN field
   in order to determine length of the command. Since the length field is (in most
   cases) already set from the underlying device driver or protocol, the field is
   never omitted.



2 Commands

   The address field contains the source/destination address. All clients communicate
   exclusively with the master and destination/source address is therefore implicitly
   the master.
   
   Some commands require to be acknowledged by the target device. Unless
   otherwise noted, a reply from the target device is made by sending the
   same command again with its own address set in the address field. Transmission
   of the payload data may be omitted in acknowledgement packets and should
   not be checked on the receipient side.

   In general, two distinct command types exist: Query and setting commands.
   An acknowledgement to a set-command is signalled by sending an empty package
   with the same LTYPE field. Queries are responded to by sending a package
   with the same LTYPE field and the response included in the payload field.


2.1 Table of commands

   The following list provides a list of commands in protocol version 1.0:

   LTYPE BYTE   #Follow-up   Function
   [SET],[QRY]     Bytes   

   0x00              0       Emergency stop
   0x01              2       End of master timeslot countdown
        0x02         5       Timeslot assignment request
   0x03              8       Timeslot assignment acknowledge
   0x04              0       Resume operation
   0x05              0       Disassociation
   0x06,0x07      2+n,2      Configuration blob setting/query
   0x08              0       Reboot (to bootloader)

   0x10,0x20         4       Light control
   0x11,0x21        n*3      Servo control
   0x12,0x22         1       Coupler control
   0x13,0x23         1       Pantograph control
   0x14,0x24         2       Smoke generator control
   0x15,0x25         2       Speed control
   0x16,0x26         6       Position (set & report)
   0x17,0x27         2       Target speed setting
   0x18,0x28         3       Drive-to command

   
   
2.1.1 Command "Emergency stop"
   
   All devies must stop their engines immediately when receiving this command.
   Peripheral devices, such as lighting or smoke generators may be left in their
   current state.


2.1.2 Command "End of master timeslot countdown"

   The countdown marks the end of the base/master timeslot and includes the maximum
   amount of bytes that are to be sent within the timeslot (thereby, implicitly the
   timeslot length).
   The command may be sent multiple times (each with decremented countdown value)
   by the master in order to improve reliability. When transmitting the command
   mutliple times, the master must send the command with the appropriate delay in
   between the messages.
   
   
2.1.3 Timeslot assignment request
   
   Whenever a client node enters a cell, it requires a timeslot in order to respond
   to master commands.

   The address field for the request should be set to the desired/old address.

   The payload field contains 5 additional bytes as follows:

   * Byte 0:     Capability flags
    ** bit 0: when set, this indicates that the device is able to perform channel
              occupancy detection.
    ** bits 1-7: unused/RFU

   * Bytes 1-4:  UUID of device
     This field includes the unique ID of the device


2.1.4 Timeslot assignment acknowledge
   
   This message is used to assign a timeslot to a client node or change its current
   timeslot. If the client requested a timeslot, the master sets the address field
   to address 0x0000 - in this case, a client must temporarily accept & parse commands
   sent to this address.
   If the master needs to change the timeslot, the client address should be set to the
   current address of the client, since the client already is in active mode at that
   time.

   In any case, the client must check if the UUID of the timeslot assignment command
   matches its UUID and upon successful check, must set the timeslot and address
   accordingly.
