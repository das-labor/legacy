CONFIG_AHB_DEFMST
  Sets the default AHB master (see AMBA 2.0 specification for definition).
  Should not be set to a value larger than the number of AHB masters - 1.
  For highest processor performance, leave it at 0.

Default AHB master
CONFIG_AHB_RROBIN
  Say Y here to enable round-robin arbitration of the AHB bus. A N will
  select fixed priority, with the master with the highest bus index having
  the highest priority.

Support AHB split-transactions
CONFIG_AHB_SPLIT
  Say Y here to enable AHB split-transaction support in the AHB arbiter.
  Unless you actually have an AHB slave that can generate AHB split
  responses, say N and save some gates.

Default AHB master
CONFIG_AHB_IOADDR
  Selects the MSB adddress (HADDR[31:20]) of the AHB IO area, as defined 
  in the plug&play extentions of the AMBA bus. Should be kept to FFF 
  unless you really know what you are doing.

APB bridge address          
CONFIG_APB_HADDR
  Selects the MSB adddress (HADDR[31:20]) of the APB bridge. Should be
  kept at 800 for software compatibility.
