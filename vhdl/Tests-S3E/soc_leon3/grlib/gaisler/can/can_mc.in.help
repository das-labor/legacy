CAN interface enable
CONFIG_CAN_ENABLE
  Say Y here to enable one or more CAN cores. The cores has one
  AHB slave interface for accessing the control registers. The CAN core
  is register-compatible with the SAJ1000 core from Philips, with a
  few exceptions. See the GRLIP IP manual for details.

CONFIG_CAN_NUM
  Number of CAN cores. The module allows up to 8 independent
  CAN cores to be implemented.

CAN register address
CONFIG_CANIO
  The control registers of each CAN core occupies 256 bytes, and 
  address space needed for the full module is thus 2 Kbyte. The cores
  are mapped in the AHB bus I/O area (0xFFF00000 - 0xFFFFF000). 
  This setting defines at which address in the I/O area the registers
  appear (HADDR[19:8]).

CAN interrupt
CONFIG_CANIRQ
  Defines which interrupt number the CAN core will generate.

CAN interrupt
CONFIG_CANSEPIRQ
  Say Y here to assign an individual interrupt to each CAN core,
  starting from the base interrupt number. If set to N, all
  CAN cores will generate the same interrupt.
