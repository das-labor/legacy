CAN interface enable
CONFIG_CAN_ENABLE
  Say Y here to enable the CAN interace from OpenCores. The core has one
  AHB slave interface for accessing the control registers. The CAN core
  ir register-compatible with the SAJ1000 core from Philips.

CAN register address
CONFIG_CANIO
  The control registers of the CAN core occupy 4 kbyte, and are 
  mapped in the AHB bus I/O area (0xFFF00000 - 0xFFFFF000). This setting
  defines at which address in the I/O area the registers appear (HADDR[19:8]).

CAN interrupt
CONFIG_CANIRQ
  Defines which interrupt number the CAN core will generate.

CAN loob-back testing
CONFIG_CANLOOP
  If you say Y here, the receiver and trasmitter of the CAN core will
  be connected together in a loop-back fashion. This will make it 
  possible to perform loop-back test, but not data will be sent
  or received from the outside. ONLY for testing!
