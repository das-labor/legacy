Timer module enable
CONFIG_GPT_ENABLE
  Say Y here to enable the Modular Timer Unit. The timer unit consists
  of one common scaler and up to 7 independent timers. The timer unit
  is needed for Linux, RTEMS, eCos and the Bare-C run-times.

Timer module enable
CONFIG_GPT_NTIM
  Set the number of timers in the timer unit (1 - 7).

Scaler width
CONFIG_GPT_SW
  Set the width if the common pre-scaler (2 - 16 bits). The scaler
  is used to divide the system clock down to 1 MHz, so 8 bits should
  be sufficient for most implementations (allows clocks up to 256 MHz).

Timer width
CONFIG_GPT_TW
  Set the width if the timers (2 - 32 bits). 32 bits is recommended
  for the Bare-C run-time, lower values (e.g. 16 bits) can work with
  RTEMS and Linux.

Timer Interrupt
CONFIG_GPT_IRQ
  Set the interrupt number for the first timer. Remaining timers will
  have incrementing interrupts, unless the separate-interrupts option
  below is disabled.

Watchdog enable
CONFIG_GPT_WDOGEN
  Say Y here to enable the watchdog functionality in the timer unit.

Watchdog time-out value
CONFIG_GPT_WDOG
  This value will be loaded in the watchdog timer at reset.
