On-chip ram
CONFIG_AHBRAM_ENABLE
  Say Y here to add a block on on-chip ram to the AHB bus. The ram
  provides 0-waitstates read access and 0/1 waitstates write access.
  All AHB burst types are supported, as well as 8-, 16- and 32-bit
  data size.

On-chip ram size
CONFIG_AHBRAM_SZ1
  Set the size of the on-chip AHB ram. The ram is infered/instantiated
  as four byte-wide ram slices to allow byte and half-word write
  accesses. It is therefore essential that the target package can
  infer byte-wide rams. This is currently supported on the generic,
  virtex, virtex2, proasic and axellerator targets.

On-chip ram address
CONFIG_AHBRAM_START
  Set the start address of AHB RAM (HADDR[31:20]). The RAM will occupy
  a 1 Mbyte slot at the selected address. Default is A00, corresponding
  to AHB address 0xA0000000.
