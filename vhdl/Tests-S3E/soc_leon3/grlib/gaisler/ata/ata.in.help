CONFIG_ATA_ENABLE
  Say Y here to enable the ATA interace from OpenCores. The core has one
  AHB slave interface for accessing all control registers. 

ATA register address
CONFIG_ATAIO
  The control registers of the ATA core occupy 256 byte, and are 
  mapped in the AHB bus I/O area (0xFFF00000 - 0xFFFFF000). This setting
  defines at which address in the I/O area the registers appear (HADDR[19:8]).

ATA interrupt
CONFIG_ATAIRQ
