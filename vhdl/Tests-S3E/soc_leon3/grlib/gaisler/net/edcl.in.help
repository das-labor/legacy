Ethernet DSU enable
CONFIG_DSU_ETH
  Say Y to enable the Ethernet Debug Communication Link (EDCL). The link
  provides a DSU gateway between ethernet and the AHB bus. Debugging is
  done at 10 or 100 Mbit/s, using the GRMON debug monitor. You must
  enable the GRETH Ethernet MAC for this option to become active.

Size of EDCL trace buffer
CONFIG_DSU_ETHSZ1
  Select the buffer size (in kbytes) for the EDCL. 1 or 2 kbyte is
  usually enough, while a larger buffer will increase the transfer rate.
  When operating at 100 Mbit, use a buffer size of at least 8 kbyte for
  maximum throughput.

MSB IP address
CONFIG_DSU_IPMSB
  Set the MSB 16 bits of the IP address of the EDCL.

LSB IP address
CONFIG_DSU_IPLSB
  Set the LSB 16 bits of the IP address of the EDCL.

MSB ethernet address
CONFIG_DSU_ETHMSB
  Set the MSB 24 bits of the ethernet address of the EDCL.

LSB ethernet address
CONFIG_DSU_ETHLSB
  Set the LSB 24 bits of the ethernet address of the EDCL.
