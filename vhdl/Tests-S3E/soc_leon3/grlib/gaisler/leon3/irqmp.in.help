LEON3 interrupt controller
CONFIG_IRQ3_ENABLE
  Say Y here to enable the LEON3 interrupt controller. This is needed
  if you want to be able to receive interrupts. Operating systems like
  Linux, RTEMS and eCos needs this option to be enabled. If you intend
  to use the Bare-C run-time and not use interrupts, you could disable
  the interrupt controller and save about 500 gates.
