SDRAM controller enable
CONFIG_SDCTRL
  Say Y here to enabled a 32/64-bit PC133 SDRAM controller. 

SDRAM controller inverted clock
CONFIG_SDCTRL_INVCLK
  If you say Y here, the SDRAM clock will be inverted in respect to the
  system clock and the SDRAM signals. This will limit the SDRAM frequency
  to 50/66 MHz, but has the benefit that you will not need a PLL to
  generate the SDRAM clock. On FPGA targets, say Y. On ASIC targets,
  say N and tell your foundry to balance the SDRAM clock output.

64-bit data bus
CONFIG_SDCTRL_BUS64
  Say Y here to enable 64-bit data bus.
