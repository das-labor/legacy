SDRAM controller enable
CONFIG_DDRSP
  Say Y here to enabled a 16-bit DDR266 SDRAM controller. 

Power-on init
CONFIG_DDRSP_INIT
  Say Y here to enable the automatic DDR initialization sequence.
  If disabled, the sequencemust be performed in software before
  the DDR can be used. If unsure, say Y.

Memory frequency
CONFIG_DDRSP_FREQ
  Enter the frequency of the DDR clock (in MHz). The value is
  typically between 80 - 133, depending on system configuration.
  Some template design (such as the leon3-avnet-eval-lx25)
  calculate this value automatically and this value is not used.

Column bits
CONFIG_DDRSP_COL
  Select the number of colomn address bits of the DDR memory.
  Typical values are 8 - 11. Only needed when automatic DDR
  initialisation is choosen. The column size can always be
  programmed by software as well.

Device density
CONFIG_DDRSP_64M
  Select the size (Mbits) of the used DDR device. Only needed
  when automatic DDR initialisation is choosen. The device size
  can always be programmed by software as well.
